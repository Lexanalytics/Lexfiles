    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  MOHAMMED LAWAL GARBA, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  The High Court of Lagos State, Ikeja Lower Court entered judgement under Order 20 of its Rules of Civil Procedure, 2012 2002 Rules on the 26th November, 2013 in Suit No. LD98412 in favour of the Appellant, which was executed.  Subsequently, the Respondents; who were not parties to the suit, filed separate applications before the Lower Court and sought similar reliefs of: “1. For an order joining the applicants. 2. For leave extending time within which the Applicant may apply for leave to set aside the execution. 3. An order granting leave to the Applicant to apply to set aside the execution. 4. An order setting aside the execution.”  On the 10th February, 2015 the Lower Court granted the reliefs sought by the Respondents and dismissed the Appellant’s suit. Being aggrieved by that decision, the Appellant, vide the Notice of Appeal of 23rd February, 2015 brought this appeal against same on eleven 11 grounds.  Four 4 issues were distilled from the grounds and submitted to the Court for determination in the Appellant’s brief filed on the 27th May 2019, pursuant to the Order by the Court. Issues are: - “3.1 WHETHER the lower Court was right in assuming jurisdiction over the two applications the subject matter of this appeal From Grounds 1, 3 and 6. 3.2 WHETHER the ruling of the lower Court met the standard prescribed by law. From Grounds 2 and 3. 3.3 WHETHER the ruling of the lower Court was in consonance with the evidence before it From Grounds 4, 5, 9 and 11. 3.4 WHETHER the lower Court was right in holding that this suit was an abuse of the process of the Court From Grounds 7, 8 and 10.”  The 1st Respondent filed a brief on the 20th June, 2017 in which a preliminary objection was raised and argued.  On their part, the 2nd-4th Respondents filed their brief on 28th November, 2016 which was deemed on the 22nd May, 2019 as well as a Notice of Preliminary Objection on the 17th January, 2017.  In addition to their objection, the Respondents raised issues which are said to call for decision by the Court in their respective briefs. The 1st Respondent’s sole issue is as follows: - “Whether the lower Court was right to assume jurisdiction over the 1st Respondent’s Application and set aside the execution of the judgment on the 1st jurisdiction on the 1st Respondent”.  The 2nd - 4th Respondents’ Issues are: - “i. Whether the Trial Court was right to assume jurisdiction over the 2nd - 4th Respondents’ Application dated 20th October, 2014 and consequently set aside the judgement dated 26th November, 2013 and the execution thereon GROUNDS 1, 8, 9 and 11 ii. Whether the Trial Court was wrong for dismissing Suit No. LD9842012 and setting aside the Judgement dated 26th November, 2013 and execution thereon as same constitutes abuse of Court processes in the face of the existence of Suit No. LD182002 GROUNDS 2, 7, 10.”  The Appellant in response and answer to the objection and other arguments in the Respondents’ briefs, filed an Additional Respondents’ brief on 27th May, 2019.  Looking at the common complaints presented in the grounds of the appeal, the 1st Respondent’s sole issue appears to be the crucial and germane issue for the proper determination of the appeal and on the authority of Tarzoor v. Ioraer 2016 3 NWLR Pt. 1500 463 @ 506; Okafor v. Abumofuani 2016 12 NWLR Pt. 1525 117;Gov., Ekiti State v. Olubunmo 2017 3 NWLR Pt. 1551 1 @ 23 and Sha v. Kwan 2000 8 NWLR Pt. 670 685 @ 700, I intend to decide the appeal on the basis of that issue, taking into consideration the parties’ relevant submissions thereon.  However, in line with the prudent judicial practice, I would deal with and determine the preliminary objection to the competence of the appeal raised and canvassed by the Respondents, since it goes to and questions the Court’s jurisdiction to adjudicate over the appeal. The objection raised by the two 2 sets of Respondents; i.e., the 1st and 2nd - 4th Respondents, is premised on the same ground of the competence of the originating process filed in the Lower Court to commence the Appellant’s suits. The common ground of the objection is that the originating processes; writ of summonsand statement of claim, were signed in the name of a Law Firm and not by a registered legal practitioner whose name is on the Roll of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. That the suit was incompetent and the Lower Court lacked the requisite jurisdiction to adjudicate over it.  1st Respondent’s Submissions: Citing Okorocha v. UBA Plc 2011 1 NWLR Pt. 1228 348 @ 377 on the process to be considered by a Court in the determination of jurisdiction, Jev v. Iyortyom 2014 14 NWLR Pt. 1428 575 @ 611 on the effect of lack of jurisdiction as well as Sections 21 and 24 of the Legal Practitioners Act, 2004 LPA and Order 6, Rule 23 of the Lower Court’s Rules, 2012, it is submitted that only Legal Practitioners provided for in Sections 21 and 24 of Legal Practitioners Act can validly sign any process to be filed in a Court of law in Nigeria and that any such process signed in the name of a Law Firm, is incurably bad and incompetent. Among other cases, the very famous case on the point; Okafor v. Nweke 2007 10 NWLR Pt. 1043 52 along with FBN, Plc v. Maiwada 2013 5 NWLR Pt. 1348 444 @ 499, are relied on for the submission and the Court is urged to uphold the objection and dismiss the appeal.  2nd -4th Respondents’ Submissions: Substantially, the submissions are to the same effect as those made in the 1st Respondent’s brief on the objection and after reference to the case of Alawiye v. Ogunsanya 2013 5 NWLR Pt. 1348 570, among others, on when a Court is said to be competent and the fundamental nature of jurisdiction in judicial proceedings, it is submitted that the Appellant’s case was not initiated by the due process of the law since the initiating processes were not signed in accordance with the requirement of the law, thereby robbing the Lower Court of the requisite jurisdiction to adjudicate over it. Order 6, Rule 23 of the Lower Court Rules, 2012 was cited and it is maintained that the initiating processes in the Appellant’s suit before the Lower Court were not signed by a legal practitioner known to law and so incompetent. The Court is urged to strike out the appeal.  Appellant’s Submissions: In the Reply brief, it submitted for the Appellant that the objection by the Respondents is misconceived even though the position of the law in the cases cited in support thereof is incontrovertible, but inapplicable to the Appellant’s case. Citing pages 43 and 44 of the Record of Appeal, it is contended that the Writ of Summons was signed by Toba Olofinjana and conceded that the Statement of Claim at pages 45-47 of the Record of Appeal was, on the surface, not signed, but actually signed by the same Olofinjana; a legal practitioner as borne out at pages 39-42 of the 2nd Additional Record of Appeal received in the Court on the 13th January, 2017.  The Court is urged to discountenance the objection by the Respondents and determine the appeal on the merit.  Resolution: The Learned Counsel for the Appellant is right when he said that the state or position of the law on the incompetence or invalidity of an originating or initiating processes filed in a Court of law, signed in the name of a Law Firm, is incontrovertible because it has been firmly established by the judicial authorities cited by the Learned Counsel for the Respondent in support of their objection, and more. See SLB Consortium Ltd v. NNPC 2011 9 NWLR Pt. 1252 317; Abbas v. Tera 2013 12 NWLR Pt. 1338 284; Nwaigwe v. Okere 2008 5 SCNJ, 256; Braithwaite v. Skye Bank Plc 2013 5 NWLR Pt. 1346 1; MTN Nig. COMM. Ltd v. C. C. Inv. Ltd 2015 7 NWLR Pt. 1459 437. By way of a restatement, the law is that for a judicial process or any process to be filed in a Court of law for and on behalf of a party in a case to be valid and competent, it must be signed by an identified legal practitioner in person whose name is on the Roll of Barristers and Solicitors at the Supreme Court of Nigeria and who is entitled to practice as a Barrister and Solicitor as prescribed in the provisions of Section 21 and 24 of the Legal Practitioners Act. The law is also that a registered Law Firm, office or practice of Legal Practitioners does not constitute and is not an identified legal practitioner whose name is on the Roll and entitled, as a person, to practice as a Barrister or solicitor under the provisions of Section 21 and 24 of the Legal Practitioners Act and so does not possess the competence to sign a judicialCourt processes for and on behalf of a party to a case before a Court of law in Nigeria. In consequence whereof, any Court processes signed in the name of a Law Firm, Office or Practice for and on behalf of a party in a case before a Court is incurably incompetent and bad such that any subsequent proceedings based or predicated thereon would be vitiated, rendered null, void and of no legal effect by the incompetence of the process. For an initiating or originating judicial or Court process, its incompetence and invalidity would render all subsequent steps taken andor proceedings conducted on the basis thereof , null, void and of no legal effect, ab initio, since there would be no foundation in law, upon which they could stand. By the popular saying of that Legal colossus and Judicial legendary; Lord Denning, MR, in the famous case of Mcfoy v. UAC 1962 AC, 152 @ 160 that “you cannot place something on nothing and expect it to stand.”  In order to determine an objection that an initiating or originating process filed in a Court to commence a suit or matter for and on behalf of a party, was not signed as required by the law, by a legal practitioner known to the law, the Court will look at and carefully consider the process in question, physically since it will speak for itself.  The initial originating process filed by the Appellant before the Lower Court is at pages 1-2 of the Record of Appeal and glaringly, no name of a legal practitioner is set out thereon as the Counsel for the claimant who signed it. All that appears at page two 2 of the process; Summons For Possession dated 20th September 2011, filed under the provisions of Order 53, Rule 3 of the Lower Court’s Rules, 2012, is as follows: - “Funmi Ade-Jombo & Co Counsel for the claimant Imole Chambers 11, Abeokuta Expressway Dopemu Agege Lagos State.”  A signature was inscribed on top or above the Law Firm of Funmi Ade-Jombo & Co., as Counsel for the Claimant. In the course of trial, the Lower Court on the 5th June, 2012 converted the summons for possession, to a writ of summons and ordered the claimant Appellant to file the writ and pleadings accordingly. Pursuant to that order, the Appellant filed a writ of summons and statement of claim both dated the 27th June, 2012 in Suit No. LD9842012, and these processes became the initiating processes used to commence the Appellant’s case against the Respondents before the Lower Court and on the basis of which the mattercase proceeded to trial. The Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim issued and filed pursuant to the order of the Lower Court were brought under Order 3, Rule 3 of the Rules of that Court and are at pages 43-44 and 45-46 respectively of the Record of Appeal. Patently, the writ of summons was signed at the signature column on page 44, by Toba Olofinjana, Esq., Claimant’s legal practitioners, of Toba Olofinjana’s Chambers. There is therefore an identified and identifiable name specifically set out on the writ of summons as the person and the legal practitioner who appended his signature thereon as the Appellant’s Counsel. The writ of summon was not signed in the name of the Law Firm of Toba Olofinjana’s Chambers as erroneously or wrongly claimed by the Respondents’ Learned Counsel.  On the Statement of Claim, although the Statement of Claim at pages 45-46 of the initial Record of Appeal, appears not to have a signature of the same Legal Practitioner who signed the Writ of Summons, and whose name appears thereon, the same Statement of Claim contained at pages 39 - 40 of the Further Additional Record of Appeal received in the Court on 13th January, 2017 and deemed on 8th June, 2018, contained and has a signature at page 40, which without any difficulty, can be observed to be substantially the same as the one on the Writ of Summons, even at a glance. None of the Respondents has challenged this Record of Appeal and so it is presumed to be correct and binding on the parties and the Court in the determination of the appeal. See Ekpemupolo v. Edremoda 2009 8 NWLR Pt. 1142 166; Madueke v. Madueke 2012 4 NWLR Pt. 1289 77;Adegbuyi v. A.P.C. 2015 2 NWLR 1442 1; Brittania-U Nig. Ltd. v. Seplat Pet. Dev. Co. Ltd 2016 4 NWLR Pt. 1503 541.  In the result, contrary to the arguments of the Learned Counsel for the Respondents, the Record of Appeal before the Court shows that both Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim dated and filed on the 27th June, 2012 before the Lower Court which were the originatinginitiating processes used to commence the Appellant’s Suit No. LD9842012 from which appeal emanated, were duly signed by a legal practitioner in accordance with the provisions of Sections 21 and 24 of the Legal Practitioners Act and so valid and competent in law for the purpose of invoking the requisite jurisdiction of the Lower Court over the suit.  The objection by the Respondents, I agree with the Learned Counsel for the Appellant, is misconceived, without merit and is dismissed.  I now revert to the identified issue which requires decision in the appeal.  Appellant’s Submissions: It is submitted on Issue One 1 that the Lower Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the two 2 applications by the Respondents to set aside the judgment delivered in favour of the Appellant since it was a final judgement on the merit. Relying on Cardoso v. Daniel 1986 2 NWLR Pt. 20 1 @ 45; Okokhue v. Obadan 1989 5 NWLR Pt. 120 185 @ 204 and page 102 of Earl Jowett’s Law Dictionary, 2nd Edition, for the definition of a judgement on the merit, it is argued that once a Court delivers judgement in a suit before it, it becomes functus officio, as defined in 8th Edition of Black’s Law Dictionary adopted in Nwoko v. Azekwo 2002 12 NWLR, page 151. Learned Counsel maintains that once a Court gives a judgement in a matter, it cannot re-open it and substitute a different decision or review or vary the judgement, except to correct accidental slips or clerical errors in order to give effect to its intention or meaning, placing reliance on Oladosu v. Olaojoyetan 2012 1 NWLR, page 285; Obiora v. C. O. P. 1990 7 NWLR Pt. 161 222 @ 232 and Onwuchekwa v. CCB Nig. Ltd 1999 5 NWLR Pt. 603 409 @ 415. In addition, it is the contention of Counsel that since the Respondents were not parties to the Appellant’s case and were not joined by the Lower Court, it lacked the jurisdiction to entertain their applications to set aside the judgment delivered in the case as their joinder was a condition precedent to its jurisdiction over the Respondents, citing Madukolu v. Nkemdilim 1962 1 ALL NLR, 587; Unipress Ltd v. Akintoyi 1992 8 NWLR Pt. 262 737 @ 747 and Abubakar v. Nasamu No.1 2012 17 NWLR, page 407, among other cases in support of the argument.  The Court is urged to set aside the Ruling by the Lower Court for want of jurisdiction on the part of Court to entertain the Respondents’ applications.  On Issues 2 and 3, it is submitted that since there were two 2 separate applications by the Respondents, the Lower Court ought to have delivered a separate Ruling in respect of each and has no jurisdiction to deliver a single Ruling in the two 2 applications even though were consolidated. Counsel said the purpose of consolidation is only for convenience and that it does not affect the individual character and identities of the maters consolidated, on the authority of Enigwe v. Akaigwe 1992 2 NWLR Pt. 225 505 @ 535.  It is also the argument of learned Counsel for the Appellant that the Lower Court in the Ruling appealed against, referred to the deposition of Adetoki, Esq., which was not in the affidavit evidence before it and an issue not canvassed by any of the parties. According to him, relying on, inter alia, Ogiamien v. Ogiamien 1967 NMLR, 245, Adeosun v. Babalola 1972 7 NSCC, 401 @ 405 and Olubode v. Oyesina 1977 11 NSCC, 286 @ 291, the Ruling was perverse and should not be allowed, to stand as it has occasioned a miscarriage of justice since without reference and admission of the said deposition, the decision would have been otherwise. Several other cases on the qualities of a good judgment were referred to and it is further argued that the Lower Court did not draw correct inference from Exhibit E and failed to pronounce on all the issues before it. Olowolagba v. Bakare 1998 3 NWLR Pt. 543 528 @ 534 and Ukpai v.Okoro 1983 2 SCNLR, 380 are referred to and the reliefs sought in the applications before which were said not to have been pronounced upon in the Ruling, are stated. Then the authority of Attorney General of the Federation v. Ijewere 1995 8 NWLR Pt. 415 618 @ 625 and Anatogu v. Iweka 1995 8 NWLR Pt. 415 547, were referred to on the conditions and constituent of fraud which can lead to setting aside a judgment of a Court and the consequence thereof.  On Issue 4, it is submitted that the issues and parties in the Appellant’s case and the Suit No. LD18202002 were not the same even though the matter is the same, and reference was made to page 1 and 299, 45-46 of the Record of Appeal as well as Pages 49-69 and 75 of the Additional Record of Appeal. Arubo v. Aiyeleru 1993 3 NWLR Pt. 280 126 @ 142 and 146, Saraki v. Kotoye 1992 9 NWLR Pt. 264 156 @ 188-9, among other cases, were cited on the principle of abuse of Court process and consequence thereof and it is argued that the parties are not the same since the Appellant was sued as Defendant in Suit No. LD18202002 while in suit before the Lower Court, he was the claimant, relying on the statement in Ekpuk v. Okon 2002 5 NWLR Pt. 780 445 and Okafor v. Attorney General, Anambra State 1991 6 NWLR Pt. 200 659 @ 681. It is submitted that the Lower Court erred in holding that the Appellant’s case is an abuse of Court process in relation to Suit No. LD18202002.  The Court is urged, in conclusion, to allow the appeal and set aside the Ruling of the Lower Court.  1st Respondent’s Submission: The submissions are that the decision of the Lower Court which the 1st Respondent applied to set aside, was entered in default of pleadings under Order 20 of the 2012 Rules and that Rule 12 of Order 20 as well as Order 30, Rule 42 of the Rules confer a discretion on the Lower Court to set aside such a judgment. The cases of Maduike v. Tetelis Nigeria Limited 2015 LPELR no page provided, Elias v. Ecobank LER sic 2016 CAL8732014 AND Olatunji v. Owena Bank 2002 15 NWLR Pt. 790 272 @ 290 were cited on the power of the Lower Court under Order 20, Rule 2012 of its Rules, to set aside its decision made in the absence of jurisdiction and to set aside execution carried out on the basis of such decision, for being wrongful. Akinyemi v. Soyanwo 2006 13 NWLR Pt. 998 496 @ 511 was also referred to and it is said that the Lower Court has the jurisdiction to entertain and decide “the matter” one way or the other.  In conclusion, the Court is urged to dismiss the appeal in its entirety and uphold the decision by the Lower Court.  2nd - 4th Respondent Submissions: The submissions on issue 1 are the same with those of the 1st Respondent reviewed above and it is further submitted, on the authority of FBN, Plc v. Akpan 2012 2 NWLR Pt. 1283 138 @ 144, that a Court of record has the power to set aside its order or judgment made in the absence of a party on application by the affected party, until it pronounces a judgment on the merit or by consent of the parties. N.U.R.T.W. v. R.T.E.A.N 2012 10 NWLR Pt. 1307 170 @ 187 and Green v. Green 1987 3 NWLR Pt. 160 480 are referred on the judgment of a Court given in the absence of a necessary or desirable party and it is submitted that the 2nd - 4th respondents showed by Affidavit evidence before the Lower Court that they were not made parties to the Appellant’s case and were not aware of the suit until when execution of the judgment there in was levied on their property, the subject matter of the Suit No. LD18202002 between them and the Appellant. According to learned counsel, there was material suppression and gross misrepresentation of facts as to the existence of Suit No. LD18202002 by the Appellant on the Suit No. LD9842012, citing page 464 of the Record of Appeal and Tomtec Nigeria Limited v. F.H.A. 2009 12 SC Pt. 3 162 @ 190-1, among other cases. It is then submitted that the Lower Court was right to have assumed jurisdiction over the application and was right to set aside the judgment obtained by fraud and misrepresentation of facts on the authority of Ibrahim v. Ojonye 2012 3 NWLR Pt. 1206 no page provided but is 108.  On issue 2, it is contended that the Lower Court was right to have held that the Appellant’s suit was an abuse of Court process in view of the Suit No. LD18202002 and the cases of Dapialong v. Dariye 2007 8 NWLR Pt. 1036 234 @ 322 and Umeh v. Iwu 2008 2 - 3 SC Pt. 1 135 @ 152 inter alia, are cited on what constitutes an abuse of Court process and consequence thereof.  The Court is urged to hold that the appeal is lacking in merit and to dismiss same with substantial costs in favour of the 2nd - 4th Respondents.  Resolution: For being elementary now in our judicial jurisprudence, the crucial and fundamental nature as well as the consequence or effect of a defect or absence of jurisdiction of a Court to adjudicate over a matter or case on any cognizable ground, needs only be acknowledge and restated, briefly for the purpose of record. Being the life blood of judicial proceedings, defect in or lack of jurisdiction on the part of a Court to adjudicate over a matter or case, will necessarily deprive the Court of the judicial power and authority to conduct valid proceedings, make binding findings or orders and reach decisions capable of being enforced in a case. Situations, circumstances in which and the factors that must exist to enable a Court to assume and exercise the requisite jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate over a matter or case are also now common knowledge in the Courts of record in Nigeria from the time of Madukolu v. Nkemdilim supra and do not need repetition all the time.  Ordinarily, the jurisdiction of Courts of law to adjudicate over matters or cases that may be brought before them, is vested or conferred on them, by the statutes or Laws by which they were established or created, be it the Constitution or the statutes or laws enacted pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution. Such jurisdiction vested or conferred on the Courts by the statutes or Laws, can only be expounded but not expanded or extended by the Courts. See Governor, Kwara State v. Gafar 1997 7 NWLR Pt. 511 51, Okulate v. Awosanya 2000 1 SC, 107, Messrs NV Scheep v. The MV' S. Araz 2000 12 SC Pt. 1 164, Abbas v. C.O.P. 1998 12 NWLR Pt. 577 308, Oyakhire v. Umar 1998 3 NWLR Pt. 542 438, Offion v. Director of Prisons 1999 14 NWLR Pt. 638 330, Sanyaolu v. INEC 1999 10 Pt. 612 600.  In this regard, it is important to note that there are two 2 categories of jurisdiction as far as the Courts of law are concerned. The first category is jurisdiction as a matter of substantive law conferred on or vested in a Court by substantive legislations, including the Constitution, which, as stated above, is specifically provided for by the relevant statutes or law. This category of jurisdiction cannot be altered, expanded or extended either by acquiescence or consent of the partieslitigants, or by the Courts. Once a statutelaw says that a Court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate over a matter or case, then the parties cannot by agreement or submission or acquiescence confer valid jurisdiction on that Court to entertain and adjudicate over the matter. On its part, a Court lacks the legal and judicial competence to vest itself with requisite jurisdiction to adjudicate over such a matter or case. Onyema v. Oputa 1987 6 NSCNJ, 176, Olaniyi v. Aroyehun 1991 5 NWLR Pt. 194 652, Dateme v. Duke 2006 ALL FWLR Pt. 313 159, Oloruntoba Oju v. Abdul-Raheem 2009 6 MJSC Pt. 1 1, Nyame v. FRN 2010 7 NWLR Pt. 1193 344.  The second category of jurisdiction as a matter of procedural law is that which deals with the mode, procedure or manner in which the substantive jurisdiction of a Court may be exercised. Here, a party may and can waive a matter of procedural law and the Court may in such a situation, proceed with the exercise of its substantive jurisdiction over a mattercase on the basis of the agreement, acquiescence, or consent or voluntary submission of the parties in respect of the procedural requirement. See Ndayako v. Dantoro 2004 13 NWLR pt. 889 187, Etim v. Obot 2010 12 NWLR Pt. 1207 108.  The complaint of the Appellant under his issue 1 appears to fall into the category of procedural jurisdiction as his grouse, is that the Lower Court lacks the jurisdiction to entertain the applications by the Respondents to set aside its final judgment which was delivered on the merit.  Generally and procedurally, once a Court of law pronounces or delivers a final decisionjudgment in a mattercase, whether on the merit or otherwise, it becomes functus officio in the mattercase, having exercised its jurisdiction fully, and would lack the requisite judicial competence or jurisdiction to re-open, for the purpose of re-hearing or review of the case or decisionjudgment pronounceddelivered by it. In other words, a Court cannot subsequently sit on appeal over its final decisionjudgment once entered pronounceddelivered in a case. Akibu v. Race Auto Supply Company Limited 2000 14 NWLR Pt. 686 190, Mark v. Eke 2004 5 NWLR Pt. 865 54, Abah v. Jabusco Nigeria Limited 2008 3 NWLR Pt. 1075 526, Skymit Motors Limited v. UBA, Plc 2012 10 NWLR Pt. 1309 49, Stirling Engr. Nig. Ltd v. Yahaya 2005 11 NWLR Pt. 135 181.  However, another established general position of the procedural law, is that Courts of record possess and have the inherent jurisdiction to re-consider and set aside their final ordersdecisionsjudgments in identified situation or appropriate circumstances. These include when: - a The orderdecisionjudgment was obtained by fraud or deceit in the Court by the one or more of the parties; b The orderdecisionjudgment is a nullity; c The Court was obviously misled into making the orderdecision or giving the judgment under a mistaken belief that the parties consented to it; d The orderdecisionjudgment was madetakengiven without or in, the absence of the requisite jurisdiction; e The proceedings that produced the orderdecisionjudgment were such as to deprive it of the character of a legitimate adjudication. See Alao v. ACB 2000 9 NWLR Pt. 672 570, Dickson v. Okoi 2003 16 NWLR Pt. 846 397, Ejorkele v. Nwafor 2008 15 NWLR Pt. 1110 418, Alawiye v. Ogunsanya 2013 5 NWLR Pt. 1348 570, Tomtec Nigeria Limited v. FHA 2009 18 NWLR Pt. 1173 538, Bounwe v. REC, Delta State 2006 1 NWLR Pt. 961 286.  What was the nature of the judgment delivered by the Lower Court on 26th November, 2013 which it set aside in the Ruling appealed against?  As a foundation, a judgment in relation to a Court of law is defined in Section 318 of the 1999 Constitution as amended in terms of a “decision” which is said to include:- “any determination of that Court and includes judgment, decree, order, conviction, sentence or recommendation.”  By this definition, a judgment includes or means a decision or order made by a Court in the course of or at the conclusion or end of its proceedings in a matter or case which determines the rights and obligations of the parties in the matter or case. In this regard, a judgment or decision of a Court of law may broadly be classified into: - a An interlocutory decisionjudgment and b A final decisionjudgment. In Ebokam v. Ekwenibe & Son Trading Company Limited 1999 7 SC Pt. 1 39, 1999 10 NWLR Pt. 622 242, Kalgo, JSC explained the distinction between these classes of a decisionjudgment of a Court when he said: - “It is well established by a myriad of decided cases both in England and in this Country that there are two 2 distinct tests to be applied in deciding whether a decision of a Court is interlocutory or final. The two classical authorities upon which these tests are formulated are Bozson v. Altrincham U.D.C. 1903 1 KB 547 and Salaman v. Warner 1891 1 QB 734. In the Bozson’s case, at page 548 Lord Alverstone CJ said: - “It seems to me that the real test for determining this question ought to be this: - does the judgment or order as made, finally dispose of the rights of the parties? If it does, then I think it ought to treated as a final order: but if it does not, it is then in my opinion, an interlocutory order.” I entirely agree with these prepositions and what I gather from them is that where decision under consideration clearly and wholly disposes of all the rights of the parties in the case, that decision is final. But where the decision only disposes of an issue or issues in a case, leaving the parties to go back to claim other rights in the Court, then that decision is interlocutory. And in order to determine whether the decision is final or interlocutory, the decision must relate to the subject matter in dispute between the parties and not the function of the Court making the order.” See also Aqua Limited v. Ondo State Sports Council 1988 4 NWLR Pt. 91 622, Akinsanya v. UBA Limited 1986 4 NWLR Pt. 35 273, Omonuwa v. Oshodin 1985 2 NWLR Pt. 10 924, Falola v. UBA, Plc 2005 2 NWLR Pt. 924 405, Mohammed v. Olawunmi 1990 2 NWLR Pt. 133 458, Assam v. Okposin 2000 10 NWLR Pt. 676 659, Universal Trust Bank, Plc v. Odofin 2001 8 NWLR Pt. 715 296, Igunbor v. Afolabi 2001 11 NWLR Pt. 723 148, Ogolo v. Ogolo 2006 5 NWLR Pt. 972 163.  In addition to the broad classes of a judgment, a final judgmentdecision of a Court may be one on the merit or a judgmentdecision given in default of either appearance or of defence; otherwise known as a default judgment. In simple terms, a judgment on the merit is a decision givendelivered by a Court after taking evidence from the parties on all material issues of fact in dispute in a case, hearing the parties on the relevant laws and determining their rights and obligations based on the sustainability on both the facts and in law.  On its part, a default judgmentdecision is one given by a Court when a party, usually the defendant in a case, fails or refuses to take steps provided for by the Rules of a Court to either enter a formal appearance to indicate his intention to defend the case andor to omit, fail or refuse to file a defence in the case as prescribed by the rules of the Court. In the case of N.U.B. Limited v. Samba Pet. Co. Ltd. 2006 12 NWLR Pt. 992 98 a judgment on the merits and in default were described as follows:- “A judgment given after a normal trial, that is to say after evidence is taken, and submissions are made on issues of facts and the law arising from the evidence, is a judgment on the merits. On the other hand, default judgment may arise from default of appearance or defence such judgments are not judgments on the merits since it was obtained by failure of the defendant to follow certain rules of procedure.”  Oputa, JSC, in Cardoso v. Daniel 1986 2 NWLR Pt. 20 1 @45, defined a judgment on the merit as follows: - “A judgment is said to be on the merits when it is based on the legal rights of the parties as distinguished from mere matters of practice, procedure, jurisdiction or form. A judgment on the merits is therefore a judgment that determines, on an issue of law or of facts, which party is right.”  Then, in U.T.C. v. Pamotei 2002 FWLR Pt. 129 1557 @ 1609, Karibi-Whyte, Jsc, explained a default judgment thus:- “The word default which qualifies the noun “judgment” seems to me to mean a judgment obtained by a plaintiff in reliance on some omission on the part of the defendant in respect of something which he is directed to do by the rules. The word is used very widely to signify situations where a person has omitted to do what he is required to do having regard to the law governing his actions.” See also Bello v. INEC 2010 8 NWLR Pt. 1196 342, Oyegun v. Nzeribe 2010 7 NWLR Pt. 1194 577, Gambo v. Ikechukwu 2011 17 NWLR Pt. 1277 561, Ogundoyin v. Adeyemi 2001 7 SCNJ, 187, Group Captain Ibok v. Etubom Honesty II 2006 6 NWLR Pt. 1029 55.  As shown earlier, generally, a Court would lack the vires or judicial power to set aside its final judgment delivered on the merits save in the situations or circumstances, enumerated, among others. However, a default judgment, though may be final, may be and can be set aside by a Court as may be stipulated by its Rules of practice since it is one given on ground of failure to comply with the requirements of the Rules governing the action.  Now, the judgment of the Lower Court delivered on the 26th November, 2013 which appears at page 461-467 of the Record of Appeal commenced as follows: - “This suit was first initiated by an originating summons filed pursuant to the special procedure for recovery of property as enshrined in Order of the 2012 HCLCPR. However pursuant to an order of Court made on 5th June 2012, the summons was converted to a writ and parties ordered to file frontloaded pleadings. Thus, on 270612 the claimant filed a frontloaded statement of claim. The processes were duly served on the defendants as evidence by the bailiffs’ affidavit of service placed before me. The defendants however elected not to respond in any manner to the Court processes. Pursuant to the claimants’ application, the suit was set down for a hearing on 220113, as an undefended claim.”  In the course of the judgment, the Lower Court stated at page 462 of the Record of Appeal that: - “On said date learned counsel for the claimant S. O. Ogun, Esq. adopted his final address filed on 280613 and was granted leave to make oral submissions in further elucidation of same.”  Then at page 463 of the Record of Appeal the Lower Court said that:- “After a careful consideration of the one-sided pleadings and evidence led, I am persuaded that the sole issue for determination is whether the claimant has proved his case to entitle him to the reliefs sought.”  From these portions of the judgement of the 26th November, 2013, it is beyond argument that the judgement was given “after a careful consideration of the one-sided pleadings and evidence led” by the Lower Court in the case before it “in view of the defendants” non-compliance with Order 17, Rule 1 of the 2012 HCLCPR and on the ground that ….   The defendants however elected not to respond in any manner to the Court processes.  To put it briefly, the judgment of 26th November, 2013 was a judgement given or delivered on ground of failure or default by the Respondents in the case to comply with the provisions of the Lower Courts Rules requiring them to have entered appearance and filed a defence to the action against them. Undoubtedly, the judgment qualifies as a default judgment defined and illustrated in the authorities referred to above on the point. I should perhaps point out that the fact that the plaintiff in the case filed pleadings and called evidence which were considered by the Lower Court in the judgment did change its character as a default judgment given on the one sided pleadings and evidence on the ground that the Defendants failed, omitted or even refused to comply with or abide by the rules of procedure of the Lower Court. The judgment clearly lacks the vital components of a judgment on the merits which finally determined the rights and obligations of the parties on the basis of facts presented in their respective pleadings and the evidence adduced by them in support of their respective cases to bring out the merits to be decided by the Lower Court. In these premises, the learned counsel for the Appellant is not correct in describing the Lower Court’s judgment of 26th November, 2013 as a final judgment on the merit, when as demonstrated, it is one given in default of appearanceandor defence by the Respondents.  Order 30, Rules 2 and 42 of the 2012 Rules of the Lower Court provide for situations where a Defendant to a case fails to appear when a cause is called for hearing and for a judgment obtained in default of appearance by a party. They are as follows: - “2. When a cause is called for hearing if the claimant appears and the Defendant does not appear, the Claimant may prove his claim, so far as the burden of proof lies upon him. 42 Any Judgment obtained where any party does not appear at the trial may be set aside by the Judge upon such terms as he may deem fit.”  Order 25 provides for Case Management Conference and Scheduling and in Rules 5 b and 7 says: - “5b in the case of a Defendant, enter Judgment against him where appropriate. 7 Any Judgment given under Rule 5 or Rule 62 above may be set aside upon an application made within seven 7 days of the judgment or such other period as the Judge or ADR Judge may allow. The application shall be accompanied by an undertaking to participate effectively in the Case Management Conference or ADR, as the case may be.”  It may be recalled that the Lower Court has stated in the judgment of 26th November, 2013 that due to the non-compliance with the Rules by the Respondents, the case did not go through the case management conference.  The above provisions of Orders 25, Rules 5b 7 as well as 30, Rules 2 and 42, clearly empower the Lower Court with the judicial discretion to set aside a judgment entered or given in default of appearance or defence by a party, as it may deem fit on the peculiar facts and circumstances of a case. Being a judicial discretion the law requires that it be exercised judicially and judiciously by the Lower Court in all cases.  In the case of Mark v. Eke 2004 1 SC Pt. II 1, it was stated that: - “There is indeed, inherent power for a Court to set aside its judgment entered into in a default of taking any procedural step such as in default of appearance, generally called a default judgment.” See also Williams v. Hope Rising Vol. Funds Society 1982 1-2 SC, 145, Jonason Triangles Limited v. C.M. Partners Limited 1999 1 NWLR Pt. 588, Delta State Government v. Okon 2002 2 NWLR Pt. 752 665, Nasco Town, Plc v. Nwabueze 2014 LPELR-22526 CA, Ogolo v. Ogolo 2006 5 NWLR Pt. 972 173, Oduola v. Coker 1981 5 SC Reprint 120.  Order 20, Rule 12 of the 2012 Rules of the Lower Court then provides for the conditionsor situations in which a final judgment by default or default judgment entered by that Court may be set aside. The provisions are thus: - “Any judgment by default whether under this Order or under any Order of these rules shall be final and remain valid and may only be set aside upon application to the Judge on grounds of fraud, non-service or lack of jurisdiction upon terms as the Court may deem fit.”  These provisions are in clear, straight forward and simple terms that a default judgment or judgment by default entered by the Lower Court under the Rules shall be final, remain valid and may only be set aside on any of the following grounds:- a Fraud or, b Non-service or, c Lack of jurisdiction. It would appear that the provisions confer or vest in the Lower Court the judicial discretion to set aside a final default judgment or judgment by default only on any one of grounds stipulated therein and no more. However, as shown earlier, Order 30 Rule 42, which are later and subsequent to the provisions, vests in the Lower Court the discretion to set aside such a judgment upon such terms to be determined by it as it may deem fit in the circumstances of a case.  The community and harmonious effect of the provisions of both Order 20, Rule 12 and Order 30, Rule 42 is that the Lower Court is vested with the requisite procedural jurisdiction to set aside a final default judgment or judgment default of appearancedefence on any of the stipulated grounds or upon such terms as it may deem fit in the circumstances of a case.  In the Ruling appealed against the Lower Court inter alia, found and held at page 487 - 9 of the Record of Appeal as follows: - “With respect to the 2nd application filed on behalf of the Alayande Family dated 201014, it is evident that the family is laying claim to the subject property as their family land. It is equally evident that they have denied alienation of any portion of it to the judgment creditorrespondent herein. In addition, the Alayande Family deny having sold, alienated or allocated any portion of their family land to either of the two judgment debtors in this suit. Furthermore, they have demonstrated clearly that a previous suit as in Suit No:LD18202002 is still pending between the family and the judgment creditorrespondent herein with respect to the same parcel of land as shown on Exhibit MAT 1. It is therefore evident to this Court, that the application dated 201014, filed by the 2nd set of applicants is predicated on the tripartite grounds that i the originating processes issued in this suit were never served on them, ii That this present action is an abuse of process in the light of the pendency of Suit No: LD18202002 between the same parties seeking the same reliefs and in respect of the same subject matter, iii Finally that the judgment herein was obtained by fraud and or suppression of material facts. Abuse of process in a term generally applied to a proceeding, which is wanting in bona fide, is frivolous, vexatious or oppressive. It is usually involves some bias, malice, or some deliberateness and some desire to misuse or pervert the system of administration of justice. It can certainly manifest in many ways and I do not think that the category of what amounts to abuse of process is closed. For instance the use of a civil action to initiate an attack on a criminal Court decision for any other decision amounts to an abuse of process. Ogbuagu, JSC in ABUBAKAR VS. AP. LTD 2007 18 NWLR [Pt. 1066] @ 319 esp. @ 62 paras A denotes a perversion of the system by the use of a lawful procedure for the attainment of unlawful results ... it is a term generally applied to a proceeding which is lacking in bonfides. It has a tinge of malice. A situation of abuse of the process of Court most often arises when a party improperly or maliciously initiates another Court process when a similar one exists. By the second process, the party is involved in perversion not only of the process but also of justice. The abuse consists in the intention, purpose and aim of the person exercising the right using the judicial process to harass, irritate and annoy the adversary, and is designed to interfere with smooth administration of justice. A Court of law has the legal duty and responsibility to reject a process, which is an abuse. Finally, it is beyond controversy that it is an abuse of the Court process for different action between the same parties to be filed in different or even the same Court simultaneously. See: OLUTINRIN vs. AGAKA 1998 6 NWLR [Pt. 554] @ 366; U.B.A. PLC VS. MODE NIGERIA LIMITED 1999 12 NWLR [PT. 680] @ 16 and SARAKI vs. KOTOYE 1992 9 NWLR [Pt. 264] @ 156. In the instant case this Court is satisfied by virtue of Exhibit MAT 1 that a previous suit as in Suit No: LD18202002 is pending between the 2nd set of applicants and the judgment creditorrespondent herein. In fact the judgment creditorrespondent is the counter-claimant in the said suit filed suit by the Alaynade Family. It is equally manifest that the subject property in the previous action as in Suit: LD18202002 is the same as the subject matter in this suit. Furthermore, the claims and counterclaims in the previous suit relate to who has a better title, which is the same issue as in this present suit. I am persuaded that the 2nd set of applicants have shown unequivocally the existence of multiple actions on the same subject matter, seeking the same reliefs involving the same parties is before the same Court. In the light of this “trinity of parties, subject matter and reliefs sought” I am satisfied that this latter action as in Suit No: LD9842012 which culminated in a judgment dated 261113 is an abuse of process and I so hold. This has been a fraudulent proceeding and is liable to be set-aside in its entirety. The ultimate sanction is therefore applied and the entirety of the claims in Suit No. LD9842012 be and is hereby dismissed for being an abuse of process. The judgment in this suit entered in favour of the claimantjudgment creditor on 261113 be and is hereby set aside for being fraudulently procured. Finally, the execution purportedly levied on 020414 having been anchored on a fraudulent judgment be and is hereby set-aside in its entirety.”  The grounds on which the Lower Court set aside the judgment of 26th November, 2013 in the above passage are that: - i The Appellant’s Suit No. LD9842012 in respect of which the judgement was given, was an abuse of its process in relation to the pending Suit No. LD18202002 and ii That the judgment was fraudulently procured.  Learned Counsel has argued that the parties in the two 2 suits are not the same because the Appellant was sued as a defendant in Suit No. LD18202002 while he is the claimant in the Suit No. LD9842012. By this statement, Counsel has expressly conceded that the Appellant is a party in the two suits, which primarily, were indisputably filed in respect of claims on the Alayande Family land by both parties against each other.  It is not a requirement of the law that parties to multiple suits must be either plaintiffsclaimants or defendants in all the suits for an abuse of Court process to arise in the subsequent suits. The recognized and established position is that the parties in the multiple suits be the same in whatsoever capacity they may be in the different suits. Furthermore, addition or subtraction from the parties in multiple suits does not necessarily make the parties different so long as the same parties in the suits remain parties along with the addition of new or other parties or non-inclusion of other parties in the different suits. In the present appeal, the fact that the Appellant was claimant in Suit No. LD9842012 and a defendant in Suit No. LD18202002 did not make parties different in the two 2 suits since he admittedly is a party to both suits along with the some other parties thereto, for the purpose of the principle of abuse of Court process on ground of multiplicity of suits.  The Appellant’s Suit No. LD9842012 was against the members of the different branches of the Alayande Family while the Suit No. LD18202002 was instituted by a member of one of branches of that family against the Appellant and members of other branches of the family. So the subject matter of the two 2 suits was the Alayande Family land in respect of which claims were made by the parties in the two 2 suits. In these premises, the parties as well as the subject matter in the two 2 suits are the same. The reliefs claimed in the suits are substantially the same in the sense that ownership of or the right thereto over parcels or portions of the Alayande Family land were the principal and material issues joined by the parties. The issues to be determined by the Lower Court in the two 2 suits were therefore the same.  The Lower Court has adequately considered the principle of abuse of a Court’s process as settled by the judicial authorities referred to in the portion of the Ruling set out above. Among the cases in which the principle, which is said to be imprecise and capable of manifesting itself in a variety of infinite ways, was expounded are the famous Okafor v. Attorney General, Anambra State 1991 6 NWLR Pt. 200 659, The Vessel “SAINT ROLAND” v. Osinloye 1997 4 NWLR 452 387, FRN v. Abiola 1997 12 NWLR Pt. 448 444, NV Scheep v. MV”S” ARAZ” 2001 FWLR Pt. 134 543, Jonpal v. Afribank 2003 8 NWLR Pt. 822 290, N.I.M.B v. UBN, Plc 2004 12 NWLR Pt. 888 599.  Looking at the parties and the pleadings in both the Appellants’ Suit No. LD9842012 AND THE Suit No. LD18202002, the Lower Court is quite right in law, and I completely agree with it, that the parties, the subject matter and the material issues in dispute between the parties in the suits are the same to make the Appellant’s Suit No. LD9842012 an abuse of the earlier pending Suit No. LD.18202002 in which the Appellant made counter claims on ownership or right of title to portions or parcels of the Alayande family land against some members of the family. For the Appellant to have instituted the subsequent suit without notice to and joining the members of the family directly, was patently, fraudulent and aimed at achieving, by finagle, what he set out to claim in the counter claim against the same members in the Suit No. LD18202002. The Appellant improperly used and employed the process of the Lower Court in the subsequent suit to pervert the cause of justice, making the suit deliberately vexatious and oppressive.  For the aforenamed reasons, the Lower Court was right to have granted the Respondents’ applications and to have set aside the default judgment of 26th November, 2013 since the suit in which it was delivered was an abuse of its process and the judgment fraudulently obtained by suppression of the fact of the existence of an earlier pending suit between the parties, on the same subject matter and material issues of dispute.  I endorse that decision by the Lower Court which is completely based and predicated on the Affidavit evidence placed before it by the Respondents.  In the final result, there is no merit in this appeal and it is hereby dismissed in its entirety.  The Ruling by the Lower Court delivered on the 10th February, 2015 in the Suit No. LD9842012 is hereby affirmed.  There shall be costs of Five Hundred Thousand Naira N500,000.00 for the prosecution of the appeal in favour of the Respondents to be paid by the Appellant.   JOSEPH SHAGBAOR IKYEGH, J.C.A.:  I read in draft the exhaustive judgment prepared by my learned brother, Mohammed Lawal Garba, J.C.A., Hon., PJ and I agree with the resolution of the issues and the conclusion reached therein and abide by the consequential orders contained therein.   TIJJANI ABUBAKAR, J.C.A.:  My Lord and learned brother Garba JCA, granted me the privilege of reading before now the leading Judgment prepared and rendered by him in this appeal.  The reasoning and conclusion in the leading Judgment are accord with my own, I therefore endorse all and adopt the Judgment as my own. I have nothing extra to add.-end!   " ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  JOHN INYANG OKORO, J.S.C. Delivering the Leading Judgment: This is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Enugu Division delivered on 12th April, 2019 which affirmed the judgment of the Federal High Court Awka, dismissing the suit of the Appellants, relying only on one ground out of the various grounds raised by the 1st and 2nd Respondents in their various Notices of Preliminary Objection. The facts of the case giving birth to this appeal are as hereunder stated:- The Appellants filed an Originating Summons as Plaintiffs against 1st -3rd Respondents as Defendants in suit No. FHCAWKCS148 2018. In the said Originating Summons, the following questions were formulated:- 1. Whether having regards to the provisions of Section 31 5 and 316 of the Electoral Act 2010 as amended, the 1st defendant was qualified to be nominated as the All Progressive Grand Alliance APGA candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. 2. Whether having regard to the provisions of Section 871, 872 874 cii of the Electoral Act 2010 as amended, Rule 101 and 2 of the APGA Electoral Guidelines for Primary Election 2018, the 2nd Plaintiff is the validly nominated candidate of the 2nd defendant to represent Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in 2019 General Election. 3. Whether having regard to the provisions of Section 871, 872 874cii of the Electoral Act 2010 as amended Rule 101 and 2 of the APGA Electoral Guidelines for Primary Election 2018, the 2nd defendant ought not to have submitted the name of the 2nd Plaintiff to the 3rd defendant as its validly nominated candidate of the 2nd defendant to represent Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in 2019 General Election.  The Appellants also sought the following reliefs:- 1. A declaration of the Honourable Court that the 1st Defendant is not statutorily qualified to stand election as a candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 Election. 2. A declaration of the Honourable Court that the purported nomination of the 1st Defendant by the 2nd Defendant as its candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election is unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever. 3. A declaration of the Honourable Court that the purported nomination and submission of the 1st Defendant's name by the 2nd Defendant to the 3rd Defendant as its candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election having violated the provisions of Section 31 5 of the Electoral Act 2010 as amended is unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever. 4. An order of the Honourable Court setting aside the illegal and purported nomination and submission of the 1st Defendants name by the 2nd Defendant to the 3rd Defendant as its candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. 5. An order of the Honourable Court setting aside the illegal recognition and publication of the 1st Defendant's name by the 3rd Defendant as the 2nd Defendant's candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. 6. A declaration of the Honourable Court that the 2nd Plaintiff is the validly nominated candidate of the 2nd Defendant's candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. 7. An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the 1st Defendant from campaigning and parading himself as the 2nd Defendant's candidate for candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. 8. An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the 3rd Defendant by itself, any of its officials, or people working for and through them from further recognizing the 1st Defendant as the 2nd defendant's candidate for candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. found at pages 1 to 4 of the record of appeal.  Upon being served the Originating Summons, all the respondents filed memoranda of conditional appearances as they felt the appellants who did not take part in the primaries had no locus standi to institute the action. They however followed it up with the filing of their respective counter affidavits. The 1st and 2nd Respondents also filed preliminary objection.  In the counter affidavits relied upon by the 1st and 2nd Respondents, the judgment in suit No. OT1942018 delivered by Amaechina, J. of the Otuocha Judicial Division, Anambra State High Court of Justice was referenced and exhibited. It was contended for the 1st and 2nd Respondents that the aforesaid judgment of the Otuocha High Court had found that the alleged false information on age declaration was not proved and that the 1st Respondent was qualified to contest the subject election.  The 1st Respondent contended in his defence that the judgment in suit No. OT1942018 was a judgment in rem which binds the Appellants even though they were not parties to the action leading to the judgment. The 2nd Respondent on its part raised the point in its Notice of Preliminary Objection that suit No. FHCAWKCS1482018 was an abuse of Court process. The 2nd Respondent further contended that the originating summons filed by the Appellants was not endorsed as mandatorily required by the Sheriffs and Civil Process Act and that the said originating summons was therefore incompetent.  The trial Court heard all the objections together with the main matter and on 6th February, 2019, delivered Ruling on the Defendant's now Respondents preliminary objections on pages 630 - 631 of the Record of Appeal, the learned Trial Judge held as follows:- \"No matter how one chooses to compare the two suits, their basic similarities are unmistakable. The arrow head in both suits is the 2nd defendant in this suit. The reliefs sought herein are the same in thrust with those in the earlier suit. In my considered view, this suit constitutes a clear abuse of Court processes. It is liable to be dismissed. Having thus held, it becomes unnecessary to proceed into any other or further determination herein. This suit is accordingly hereby dismissed.\"  Dissatisfied with the above decision by the learned trial Judge, the Appellants filed Notice of Appeal against the said judgment.  The 1st Respondent on his part filed the 1st Respondent's Notice of Contention as can be found on pages 730 - 731 of the record of appeal where he contended in the main that the judgment or Ruling of the trial Court be affirmed on ground other than the grounds relied upon by the trial Court, to wit: that the judgment of Otuocha High Court is a judgment in rem which also binds the Appellants.  The 2nd Respondent on its own part filed the 2nd Respondent's Notice of Contention appearing on pages 636 -636A of the record of appeal. In this Notice, the 2nd Respondent contended inter alia that the originating summons by which this action was commenced was not properly endorsed as mandatorily required.  The Court below heard the appeal and on 12th April, 2019 delivered its judgment and held inter alia:- 1. That the issue of qualification of the 1st Respondent had been settled with finality by the judgment of Amaechina, J., of the Otuocha Judicial Division of the Anambra State High Court of Justice and that that same issue cannot be relitigated before a Court of coordinate jurisdiction as sought by the Appellants in suit No. FHCAWKCS1482018. 2. That suit No. FHCAWKCS1482018 was therefore an abuse of Court process. 3. That the Originating Summons filed by the Appellants was not properly endorsed as mandatorily required by the Sheriffs and Civil Process Act thereby rendering the originating summons incompetent.  Again, the appellants, not being satisfied with the said judgment has appealed to this Court vide Notice of Appeal filed on 23rd April, 2019.  From the three grounds of appeal as contained in the Notice of appeal, the learned counsel for the appellants, Ifeanyi Obiakor Esq., has distilled three issues for the determination of this appeal. They are contained in the Appellants' brief filed on 16519 and adopted on 13619 at the hearing of this appeal. The issues are:- 1. Whether the Court below was not in error when it affirmed the decision of the trial Court that suit No. FHCAWKCS1482018 constituted an abuse of Court process in view of the judgment in suit No. OT1942018. 2. Whether the trial Court was justified when it failed to consider the second issue submitted to it for consideration and determination. 3. Whether the non-service of the 2nd Respondent's Notice of Contention on the Appellants did not constitute a breach of their fundamental right of fair hearing.  The 1st Respondent's brief was settled by Roy O. U. Nwaeze and filed on 7619. In it, three issues are also formulated for the determination of this appeal. They are similar to those of the Appellants but couched differently as follows:- 1. Whether the Court below was not in error when it affirmed the decision of the trial Court that suit No. FHCAWKCS1482018 constituted an abuse of Court in view of the judgment in suit No. 0T1942018. 2. Whether the non-service of the 2nd Respondent's Notice of Contention on the Appellants did not constitute a breach of their fundamental right of fair hearing. 3. Whether the trial Court was justified when it failed to consider the second issue submitted to it for consideration and determination.  For the 2nd Respondent, E. N. Onyibor, Esq., of counsel, distilled two issues as follows:- 1. Whether the Court of Appeal was right in dismissing the appellants' appeal and affirming the decision of the trial Federal High Court. 2. Whether the 2nd Respondent's Notice of Contention and the argument thereof was not served on the appellants so as to raise issue off air hearing.  Learned counsel for the 3rd Respondent, Shaibu Enejoh Aruwa, Esq., distilled one double barrel issue for determination thus:- 1. Whether the Court below was not in error when it affirmed the decision of the trial Court that suit No. FHCAWK1482018 constituted an abuse of Court in view of the judgment in suit No. OT1942018 and whether the Court below was justified in failing to consider the other issues submitted for determination.  The Appellants have filed reply briefs to the Respondents' respective briefs. I shall consider them where need arises.  By Section 233 1 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended, the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction, to the exclusion of any other Court of law in Nigeria, to hear and determine appeals from the Court of Appeal. And by Section 240 of the said Constitution, appeals from the decisions of Federal High Courts lie to the Court of Appeal. There is no section of the Constitution or any other law whatsoever which allows an appeal to lie directly from the Federal High Court to the Supreme Court of Nigeria.  On a calm reading of appellants' issue No. 2, it is clear that the appellants are praying this Court to consider the conduct of the learned trial Judge who failed to consider their second issue submitted to the Federal High Court. It states:- \"Whether the trial Court was justified when it failed to consider the second issue submitted to it for consideration and determination.\" Clearly, the above issue wants this Court to assume the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to hear an appeal directly from the High Court. The Supreme Court cannot do that. This Court only hears appeals from the Court of Appeal and not from the High Court. See Oduntan & Ors v Akibu & Ors 2000 7 SC pt. 11 page 106, 2000 FWLR pt. 12 1982, Nweze v The State 2017 LPELR - 42344 SC, Attorney General of Oyo State & Anor v Fairlakes Hotel Ltd 1988 LPELR - 24926 SC, Jimoh & Ors v Akande & Anor 2009 5 NWLR pt 1135 549, Umana v NDIC 2016 LPELR - 42556 SC.  All I have said above is that issue 2 by the appellants is incompetent being an invitation to this Court to hear an appeal directly from the High Court. This is not possible. Appellants' second issue is accordingly discountenanced and struck out.  Having struck out appellants' issue No. 2, I am left with issues one and three. I shall therefore determine this appeal based on appellants' issues one and three.  ISSUE 1 On the 1st issue, the learned counsel for the appellants submitted that an abuse of Court can only arise where the action is between the same parties with respect to the same subject matter, relying on Ogoejeofo vs Ogoejeofo 2006 3 NWLR pt 966 205, Okafor v Attorney General of Anambra State, 1991 6 NWLR PT 200 659. He contended that assuming but not conceding that the subject matter of the first declaration sought by the Appellants in suit No. FHCAWKCS1482018 may be the same with that in OT1942018, that alone will not constitute suit No. FHCAWKCS1482018 an abuse of Court Process, relying on Oguebego v PDP 2016 EJSC 140 at 173.  Furthermore, learned counsel submitted that apart from not being parties in suit No. OT1942018, the parties in the two suits do not have a common interest such that the Appellants should be bound by the outcome of the said suit. That the Appellants' interest which is that the 2nd appellant contested the Primary Election of the 2nd Respondent and was nominated to fly the flag of the 2nd Respondent in the 2019 General Election while that of the plaintiff in suit No. OT1942018 is only that the 1st Respondent is not qualified to be nominated as candidate of the 2nd Respondent for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency. He urged this Court to resolve this issue in favour of the Appellants.  In response, the 1st Respondent submitted that the Court below held that the issue of qualification of the 1st Respondent was settled by Amaechina, J., of Otuocha Division of Anambra State High Court and that it will not be justified for a Court of coordinate jurisdiction to reopen the said issue. That the appellants, in his notice of appeal did not challenge the findings of the Court below that the issue of qualification of the 1st Respondent had been settled with finality by the High Court of Anambra State.  Learned counsel stated that assuming but not conceding that there was a wrong expression on the part of the Court below by holding that the Federal High Court action was an abuse of Court process in the face of judgment of the High Court of Anambra State in suit No. OT1942018, that holding did not lead to any miscarriage of justice. Learned counsel contended that their notice of contention which they filed sought the order of the lower Court affirming the judgment on the ground that it was a judgment in rem which binds not only the parties in that case but also on all parties including the appellants herein. That the Court below in acceding to the 1st Respondent's Notice of Contention, came to the conclusion that the issue of qualification of the 1st Respondent had been settled and cannot justifiably be reopened for adjudication by a Court of coordinate jurisdiction, relying onMaihaja v Gaidam & ors 2017 LPELR - 42474 SC. He urged this Court to resolve this issue against the appellants.  In his submission, the learned counsel for the 2nd Respondent submitted that this is a concurrent findings of the two lower Courts which the appellants have failed to show are perverse. Secondly, he contended that the parties subject matter and issues in both suits are the same. That a close textual juxtaposition of the principal reliefs in the two suits will show that they are patently the same as each seeks a declaration that the 1st Respondent is not qualified to contest the subject election.  Learned counsel submitted further that the appellants were privies to suit No. OT1942018 having instituted the earlier suit using false exterior and therefore caught by the doctrine of estoppel per rem judicata and res judicata, relying on Lawal v Salami 2002 2 NWLR pt 752 687, Gbadamosi v Dairo 2001 6 NWLR pt 708 137. Referring to Exhibit \"APGA - M3\" on pages 149 -166 of the record of appeal, he submitted that all the conditions for estoppel per rem judicata to operate are established. He urged this Court to resolve this issue against the appellants.  The learned counsel for the 3rd respondent submitted that the question posed for determination by the appellants before the Federal High Court had already been determined by the Anambra State High Court and it will therefore amount to an abuse of Court process to subject the same question for determination before another Court of coordinate jurisdiction. He also urged this Court to resolve this issue against the appellants.  In Appellants' reply brief to the 1st Respondents' brief, the Appellants contended that the decision in suit No. OT194 2018 did not with finality address the issue of qualification of the 1st Respondent to contest the election. According to learned counsel for the Appellants, their own contention is that the 1st Respondent has four different dates of birth.  In reply to 2nd Respondent's brief, learned Appellant's counsel submitted that the 2nd Respondent did not serve the notice of contention on them and as such they were denied fair hearing.   RESOLUTION: One issue which appears fairly settled in this appeal is that the High Court of Anambra State in suit No. OT1942018 had settled the issue of the qualification of the 1st Respondent to contest election into the House of Representatives in Anambra East and West Federal Constituency. The major issue in that case was that the 1st Respondent was not qualified based on issues relating to falsification of age. The High Court of Anambra State decided that the 1st Respondent did not falsify his age and thus cleared him to contest the said primary election. In other words, the issue as to his status when it comes to his age was settled by that Court. The appellants had subsequently filed this instant suit in the Federal High Court Awka seeking the said Court to determine the status of the 1st Respondent in connection with his age and competence to be nominated the candidate of the 2nd Respondent to contest the subject election.  In their concurring judgments, the two Courts below made the following conclusions in respect of the matter. First, the Federal High Court on page 630 of the record of appeal:-  \"No matter how one chooses to compare the two suits, their basic similarities are unmistakable. The arrow head in both suits is the 2nd Defendant in this suit. The reliefs sought therein the same in thrust with those in the earlier reliefs. In my considered view, this suit constitutes a clear abuse of Court process.\"  Then on pages 757 - 758, the Court below made the following findingsdecisions:- \"There is no doubt that the main issue and central focus of suit No. OT1942018 is the qualification of the 1st Respondent to be nominated as candidate of the 2nd Respondent for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency, Anambra State in the 2019 General Election. Before the conclusion of that suit No. OT1942018 which was commenced at the High Court of Anambra State, this present action was instituted on the 5th November, 2018. Judgment was given in the said suit No. OT1942018 by the High Court of Anambra State on the 9th November, 2018 long before this suit became ripe for hearing, thereby settling the issue of the qualification of the 1st Respondent to contest the said election. The Appellants herein had the option of abiding by that decision or as parties interested in the subject matter of dispute by filing - necessary processes that would enable them appeal it pursuant to Section 243 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended. Submitting the same issue for determination before another Court of coordinate jurisdiction was improper and as rightly held by the learned trial Judge, an abuse of the Court's process. Couching it in fine language the substance of the essential question submitted to the trial Court in this case and having consequential questions and reliefs did not change the character and essence of the main dispute. Ultimately, the main question now posed in this action has been answered by a Court of coordinate jurisdiction and the existence of this suit before the trial Court would no longer be justified.\"  It must be noted that the Appellants and the 1st Respondents are members of the same political family - the 2nd Respondent i.e. All Progressives Grand Alliance. Also the party who sued the 1st Respondent in OT194 2018 is also a member of APGA, the same family. It follows that members of the 2nd Respondent who lost out in the nomination process to become candidate of the 2nd Respondent in the election aforesaid are a more united members of the same family. They have the same grievance, interest and goal  to stop the 1st Respondent from being nominated the candidate of the 2nd Respondent. That is why the plaintiff in OT1942018 went to Court to stop the 1st Respondent from being nominated. The vehicle was issue of his age falsification. Had he succeeded, the present appellants would definitely not file their present suit on the same issue. But because \"they\" lost in that suit, they decided to take a second bite on the cherry. That is why I totally agree with the two Courts below that judgment in OT1942018 was a judgment in rem which binds the parties in the litigation and others having anything to do with the status of the 2nd Respondent so declared and pronounced by the Anambra State High Court.  Of a judgment in rem, I made it so clear in Alh. Isa Noekoer v Executive Governor of Plateau State & Ors 2018 LPELR - 44350 SC at pages 44 - 45 paragraphs B- E, as follows:- \"This Court has in quite a number of cases, not only defined the two concepts but also distinguished them. In Ikenye Dike & ors v Obi Nzeka U. & Ors 1986 LPELR - 945 SC at pages 12 - 13, paragraphs C - B - this Court held as follows. \"A judgment is said to be in rem when it is an adjudication pronounced upon the status of some particular thing or subject matter by a Tribunal having the jurisdiction and the competence to pronounce on that status. Such a judgment is usually and invariably founded on proceedings instituted against or on something or subject matter whose status or condition is to be determined. That is why a judgment in rem is a judgment contra-mundum - binding on the whole world - parties as well as non-parties...\"  In fact this Court made the point very clear in Ogboru & Anor v Uduaghan & Ors 2011 LPELR - 8236 SC at pages 41 - 42 paragraph D thus:- \"I find it convenient at this stage to define a judgment in Rem for the advantage of the appellant. \"A judgment in rem may be defined as the judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction determining the status of a person or thing as distinct from the particular interest of a party to the litigation. Apart from the application of the term to persons, it must affect the \"res\" in the way of condemnation, forfeiture, declaration, status or title. a Examples are judgment of a Court over a will creating the status of administration. b Judgment in a divorce by a Court of competence jurisdiction dissolving a marriage declaring the nullity or affirming its existence. c Judgment in an election petition. The feature of a judgment in rem is that it binds all persons whether a party to the proceedings or not. It stops anyone from raising the issue of the status of persons or things, or the rights or title to properly litigated before a competent Court. It is indeed conclusive against the entire world in whatever it settles as to status of the person or property. All persons whether party to the proceedings or not are stopped from averring that the status of persons is other than the Court has by such judgment declared or made it to be.\" Okpalugo vs Adeshoye 1996 10 NWLR pt 476 page 77, Fointrades Ltd. vs Universal Association Co. Ltd. 2002 8 NWLR pt 770 page 699, Ogbahon vs Reg. Trustees CCCG 2002 1 NWLR pt 749 page 675, Olaniyan vs Fatoki 2003 13 NWLR pt 837 page 273.\" See also Yanaty Petrochemical Ltd. v EFCC 2017 LPELR-43473 SC, Gbemisola v Bolarinwa & Ors 2014 9 NWLR pt 1411 page 1, Sosan & ors v Ademuyiwa 1986 1 NSCC 673 at 680.  A judgment in rem, being contra mudum, binds parties and their privies and non-parties as well. Therefore the argument of the appellants that they were not parties in suit No. OT194 2018 and as such are not bound by that judgment is puerile. Where a Court of competent jurisdiction has finally settled a matter in dispute between parties, neither party nor privy may relitigate that issue as under the guise of bringing a fresh action, since the matter is said to be res judicata. The judgment in suit No. OT194 2018 is a judgment of a competent Court and a judgment in rem which has determined the status of the 1st Respondent. As was rightly held by the two Courts below, a relitigation of the same issue of the falsification of age of the 1st respondent by the appellants cannot be justified as members of his party had earlier done so. See Flow Farm Industries Ltd v University of lbadan 1993 NWLR pt 290 719 at 724, Cole v Jibunoh & Ors 2016 LPELR - 40662 SC pages 16 - 17 paragraphs D - A. I agree with the two Courts below that suit No. FHCAWKCS 2018 was an abuse of Court process.  I would have ended this judgment here but for the issue raised by the 2nd respondent that the appellants did not take part in the primaries which has given birth to this suitappeal. I have carefully perused the originating summons and the affidavit in support and I can deduce that the 1st appellant is a member of APGA and a registered voter in Anambra East and West Federal Constituency. That is all. There is nothing on record to show that he was an aspirant in the subject primary election. At best, he has not said so. Now Section 879 of the Electoral Act 2010 as amended provides:- \"879 Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act or rules of a Political Party, an aspirant who complains that any of the provisions of this Act and the guidelines of a political party has not been complied with in the selection or nomination of a candidate of a political party for election, may apply to the Federal High Court or the High Court of a State or FCT, for redress.\"  The law is trite that where a political party conducts its primary and a dissatisfied contestant or aspirant at the primary complains about the conduct of the primaries, the Courts have jurisdiction by virtue of Section 87 9 of the Electoral Act reproduced above to examine if the conduct of the primary elections was in accordance with the parties constitution and guidelines. This is so because in the conduct of primaries, the Courts will not allow a political party to act arbitrarily or as it likes. A person who did not take part in the primary as a candidate or aspirant cannot invoke Section 879 of the Electoral Act, 2010 as amended to institute a case in Court. See Hope Uzodinma v Senator Osita Izunaso 2011 5 MJSC pt 1 27, PDP v Sylva & Ors 2012 LPELR - 7814 SC, Maihaja v Gaidam & ors 2017 LPELR - 42474 SC, APGA v Anyanwu 2014 7 NWLR pt 1407 541, Ukachukwu v PDP 2014 17 NWLR pt 1435 134, Daniel v INEC 2015 3-4 MJSC 1 at 45. In other words, a party who did not take part in the primaries as an aspirant has no locus standi to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court in the circumstance. The 1st appellant had no locus standi to institute this suit giving birth to this appeal.  As regards the 2nd PlaintiffAppellant, the assertion by the respondents that he did not take part in the primary election of the 2nd Respondent held on 21018 is unassailable. Apart from the fact that the 2nd Appellant failed to show in his originating summons and affidavit in support how many votes he scored to be declared winner, he did not show how the primary election was conducted. This gives vent to Exhibit \"APGA CA4\" at pages 108 - 111 of the record, particularly page 109 thereof where it is clearly shown that the 2nd Appellant was \"NOT CLEARED\" to contest the primary election. That Exhibit is the report of screening exercise conducted by the 2nd Respondent. The said report is signed by Ozonpu Dr. Victor Ike Oye, the National Chairman of APGA. As was observed by the learned counsel for the 2nd Respondent, the Appellants have not challenged the 2nd Appellants' disqualification by the 2nd Respondent in any Court. They carefully avoided this aspect. This exhibit supports the Respondents' assertion that the 2nd appellant did not take part in the primary election. Even if the 2nd appellant was an aspirant in the primary election, his case was vitiated by the presence of the 1st appellant who was clearly not an aspirant but who swore to the affidavit in support of the Originating Summons. This was a virus which vitiated the suit.  I hold the view that even the trial Federal High Court had no jurisdiction to try this case as Section 87 9 of the Electoral Act supra was not properly and validly invoked. The appellants were not aspirants at the primary election. I am surprised that the two Courts below did not say anything in this regard.  On the whole, it is crystal clear that the suit giving birth to this appeal, apart from being a clear abuse of Court process, the appellants had no locus standi to institute same. The outcome is that the appeal by the appellants is unmeritorious and is hereby dismissed. There is no need to consider the last issue in the circumstance.  Appeal Dismissed. I assess the costs in favour of the 1st and 2nd Respondents against the appellants in the sum of N500,000.   OLUKAYODE ARIWOOLA, J.S.C.: I had the privilege of reading in draft the lead judgment of my learned brother Okoro, JSC just delivered. I agree entirely with the reasoning and conclusion that the appeal is unmeritorious and should be dismissed. I too will dismiss the appeal.   AMIRU SANUSI, J.S.C.: I was obliged with a copy of the Judgment just delivered by my learned brother J. I Okoro JSC. In the said Judgment all the live issues raised and canvassed by the parties' learned counsel were adequately addressed, before His lordship arrived at the conclusion that this appeal is devoid of any merit.  I am in entire agreement with such reasoning and the conclusion arrived at in dismissing the appeal for being lacking in substance. Appeal is also dismissed by me and I endorse the order on costs made in the lead judgment.   AMINA ADAMU AUGIE, J.S.C.: I had a preview of the lead Judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Okoro, JSC, and I agree completely with his reasoning and conclusion. He addressed the Issues raised by Parties, for and against their respective positions in this Appeal meticulously, and decisively, and I see no reason to belabour the points he made.  Suffice it to say that I adopt what he said and it is on that premise that I also dismiss this Appeal and abide by the Order as to costs. The Appeal is dismissed.   PAUL ADAMU GALUMJE, J.S.C.: I have read before now the judgment just delivered by my Learned brother, John Inyang Okoro JSC, and I agree that this appeal lacks merit and should be dismissed. It is accordingly dismissed by me. I endorse all the consequential orders made in the lead judgment including order as to costs.-end!" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The Appellants filed an Originating Summons as Plaintiffs against 1st-3rd Respondents as Defendants seeking the following reliefs:- 1. A declaration of the Honourable Court that the 1st Defendant is not statutorily qualified to stand election as a candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 Election. 2. A declaration of the Honourable Court that the purported nomination of the 1st Defendant by the 2nd Defendant as its candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election is unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever. 3. A declaration of the Honourable Court that the purported nomination and submission of the 1st Defendant's name by the 2nd Defendant to the 3rd Defendant as its candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election having violated the provisions of Section 31 (5) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) is unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever. 4. An order of the Honourable Court setting aside the illegal and purported nomination and submission of the 1st Defendants name by the 2nd Defendant to the 3rd Defendant as its candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. 5. An order of the Honourable Court setting aside the illegal recognition and publication of the 1st Defendant's name by the 3rd Defendant as the 2nd Defendant's candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. 6. A declaration of the Honourable Court that the 2nd Plaintiff is the validly nominated candidate of the 2nd Defendant's candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. 7. An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the 1st Defendant from campaigning and parading himself as the 2nd Defendant's candidate for candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. 8. An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the 3rd Defendant by itself, any of its officials, or people working for and through them from further recognizing the 1st Defendant as the 2nd defendant's candidate for candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. (found at pages 1 to 4 of the record of appeal). Upon being served the Originating Summons, all the respondents filed memoranda of conditional appearances as they felt the appellants who did not take part in the primaries had no locus standi to institute the action. They however followed it up with the filing of their respective counter affidavits.  The 1st and 2nd Respondents also filed preliminary objection whereunder the judgment in suit No. OT/194/2018 delivered by Amaechina, J. of the Otuocha Judicial Division, Anambra State High Court of Justice was referenced and exhibited. It was contended for the 1st and 2nd Respondents that the aforesaid judgment of the Otuocha High Court had found that the alleged false information on age declaration was not proved and that the 1st Respondent was qualified to contest the subject election. The 1st Respondent contended in his defence that the judgment in suit No. OT/194/2018 was a judgment in rem which binds the Appellants even though they were not parties to the action leading to the judgment. The 2nd Respondent on its part raised the point in its Notice of Preliminary Objection that suit No. FHC/AWK/CS/148/2018 was an abuse of Court process. The 2nd Respondent further contended that the originating summons filed by the Appellants was not endorsed as mandatorily required by the Sheriffs and Civil Process Act and that the said originating summons was therefore incompetent. The trial Court heard all the objections together with the main matter and on 6th February, 2019, delivered Ruling on the Defendant's (now Respondents) preliminary objections on pages 630 - 631 of the Record of Appeal, the learned Trial Judge held as follows:- \"No matter how one chooses to compare the two suits, their basic similarities are unmistakable. The arrow head in both suits is the 2nd defendant in this suit. The reliefs sought herein are the same in thrust with those in the earlier suit. In my considered view, this suit constitutes a clear abuse of Court processes. It is liable to be dismissed. Having thus held, it becomes unnecessary to proceed into any other or further determination herein. This suit is accordingly hereby dismissed.\" Dissatisfied with the above decision by the learned trial Judge, the Appellants filed Notice of Appeal against the said judgment at the Court of Appeal.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  JOHN INYANG OKORO, J.S.C. Delivering the Lead Ruling:  This Court raised the issue of jurisdiction suo motu based on Section 2859 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended by the 4th Alteration Act as to when the cause of action arose vis-a-vis the date the originating summons was filed at the trial Federal High Court. Appellant agrees that at the end of the primary election on 2nd October, 2018, the 3rd Respondent purported to declare the 1st Respondent winner of the election. That the said act sparked off protest from the appellant who lodged an appeal to the 3rd Respondent’s panel but that the panel refused andor failed to look into the complaint stating that the complaint was not filed within 24 hours.  The above summation by the appellant shows that the appellant was aggrieved on 2nd October, 2018 when the decision to declare the 1st respondent winner of the election was announced. Clearly, his cause of action arose on that date. The argument by the learned Senior counsel for the appellant that the injury was continuous until general election was held does not fly at all. The 4th Alteration Act does not permit the doctrine of continuous injury as election and election related matters are sui generis.  The learned Senior counsel for the 1st Respondent and other respondents’ counsel’s argument that cause of action arose on 2nd October, 2018 is unassailable. Based on this, I agree that the filing of this suit at the trial Court on 11th December, 2018 was clearly outside the 14 days allowed by the 4th Alteration Act. The Originating Summons at the trial Court was incompetent. The judgment of the trial Court was without jurisdiction.  It is my view that both the Court below and this Court have no jurisdiction to entertain any appeal arising from the incompetent judgment of the learned trial Judge. Accordingly, this appeal is hereby struck out for want of jurisdiction. There shall be no order as to costs.   AMIRU SANUSI, J.S.C.:  I was opportuned to read in draft form, the Ruling just rendered by my learned brother John I. Okoro JSC while I agree with his reasoning and the conclusion reached, I will also offer few comments to support the Ruling.  At the hearing of this appeal, this Court suo motu invited learned counsel for the parties in this appeal to address it on issue of jurisdiction to hear the appeal in the light if the provisions of Section 285 9 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended by 4th Alteration Act.  As could be gleaned from the record of appeal, the originating Summons filed by the plaintiff at the trial Federal High Court clearly shows that the primary election was held on 2nd October 2018 in which the 1st Respondent was declared winner of the primary election by INEC, the 3rd Respondent. To my mind, that was the day when the cause of action arose. Also as clearly shown by the record, the action that culminated into this appeal was filed on 11th December 2018.  By the provisions of Section 285 9 of the 1999 Constitution as amended, such action is supposed to be filed on or before 14 days from the date of the happening of the cause of action i.e. 2nd October 2018.   The action filed vire the originating summons was therefore filed outside the 14 days stipulated by the said provisions. That being the case, the trial Court was bereft of jurisdiction to entertain and determine the suit, same having been filed out of time. Therefore, the originating summons was right from the outset and incompetent.  It goes without saying therefore that since the originating summons is incompetent, the Judgment of the trial Court was given without jurisdiction as it is a nullity as it was given by the trial Court which is bereft of jurisdiction.  Similarly, the Judgment of the lower Court is also a nullity since same was given on an incompetent suit or action.  Apropos, of the above, I adjudge this appeal to be lacking in merit and I accordingly strike it out. I make no order as to costs, so each party is to bear its his costs.   AMINA ADAMU AUGIE, J.S.C.:  I had the privilege of reading in draft the Ruling of my learned brother, Okoro, JSC. I am in complete agreement with him that both the Court of Appeal and this Court have no jurisdiction to entertain any appeal arising from the incompetent Judgment of the learned trial Judge. In the circumstances, this Appeal is struck out for want of jurisdiction. There shall be no order as to cost.   EJEMBI EKO, J.S.C.:  Upon the occurrence of any of the three circumstances; that is - \"the occurrence of the event, decision or action complained of,\" the cause of action for purposes of S.2859 of the Constitution, as amended, ripens or matures for the Plaintiff to commence his suit.  The indubitable facts of this case point to the cause of action being the disputed primary election that took place on 2nd October, 2018. It prompted the Appellant, to commence his action at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory on 19th October, 2018 - more than 14 days after the disputed election complained of. He withdrew the suit and recommenced a similar suit at the Federal High Court on 11th December, 2018 to challenge the purported or alleged sham election.  Clearly the cause of action arose on 2nd October, 2018. The suit is statute barred by operation of S.285 9 of the Constitution as amended. The jurisdiction of the trial Court was ousted thereby.  I agree that the appeal lacks substance and it is hereby dismissed as I affirm the decision of the lower Court.  Parties shall bear their respective costs.   UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI, J.S.C.:  I completely agree with the Ruling just delivered by my learned brother, John Inyang Okoro, JSC that this appeal is devoid of any merit.  Same shall be and is hereby struck out for want of jurisdiction.-end! " ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  KUDIRAT MOTONMORI OLATOKUNBO KEKERE-EKUN, J.S.C. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  This appeal is against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division delivered on 2612018, affirming the judgment of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory FCT delivered on 2042016.  The respondent sued the appellant vide an Amended originating Motion dated and filed on 732016 seeking the following reliefs: A. A Declaration that the arrest and detention of the Applicant by the Respondent since 28th December, 2015 is unlawful, unconstitutional, illegal and violation of the Applicant's fundamental rights guaranteed by Section 351 and 4 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. B. A Declaration that the restrictionconfinement placed on the Applicant by the Respondents by keeping him in their custody since December 28, 2015 is unlawful, unconstitutional and direct infraction of the rights of the Applicant to freedom of movement as guaranteed by Section 41 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. C. A Declaration that the continuing detention of the Applicant by the Respondent without informing him of his offence in writing is unlawful, unconstitutional and an infraction of the Applicant's right as guaranteed by Section 353 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. D. A Declaration that the refusal to release the Applicant until he admits laundering undisclosed amount of money or any sum whatsoever is unlawful, unconstitutional, illegal and a violation of the Applicant's Fundamental Rights as guaranteed by Section 43 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. E. An Order of injunction restraining the Respondent whether by itself, servants, privies, agents or whosoever purporting to act on its behalf from violating or further violating the fundamental rights of the Applicant as guaranteed by Section 341, 351 & 4 and 43 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. F. The sum of the sum of Two Billion Naira 2,000,000,000 only as exemplary and aggravated damages for the infraction of the Applicant's fundamental rights. G. An Order restraining the Respondent whether by itself, servants, privies, agents or whosoever purporting to act on its behalf from violating or further violating the Fundamental rights of the Applicant through prolonged detention or upon such terms as this Honourable Court may deem appropriate in the circumstances, pending the determination of this suit. H. An Order of Court for the release of the Applicant from custody of the Respondent. I. An Order directing the Respondent to tender a public apology to the Applicant. J. An Order for the immediate release of the Applicant's international passport confiscated by the Respondent. K. And for such further orders as this Honourable Court may deem fit to make in the circumstances.  Upon being served with the process, the Appellant raised a preliminary objection to the hearing of the originating process on the following grounds: i That the original originating motion was not served on it; and ii That the respondent failed to comply with the provisions of the Fundamental Rights Enforcement procedure Rules FREP, 2009 relating to the mode of commencement of an action in that the application did not contain a statement in support setting out the name and description of the applicant, the reliefs sought and the ground upon which the reliefs are sought.  In defence of the substantive application, the appellant filed a counter affidavit wherein it denied detaining the respondent or confiscating his international passport. The respondent filed a further affidavit in response to the counter affidavit and attached thereto newspaper publications concerning his detention. After listening to the parties, the trial Court, in a reserved judgment delivered on 2042016, dismissed the appellant's preliminary objections and entered judgment in the substantive suit in the respondent's favour. It found and held that the appellant unlawfully detained the respondent in its custody from 28122015 until 562016 and also confiscated his international passport, as alleged. The Court awarded N10 million Ten Million Naira as damages in favour of the respondent and against the appellant for unlawful detention.  The appellant was dissatisfied with the judgment and lodged an appeal before the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division the lower Court. In a considered judgment delivered on 26th January, 2018, the appeal was dismissed and the judgment of the trial Court was affirmed.  The appellant is still dissatisfied and has further appealed to this Court vide its Amended Notice of Appeal deemed filed on 23102019 containing 4 grounds of appeal.  At the hearing of the appeal on 31102019, I. Audu Esq., Legal Officer, EFCC, adopted and relied on the appellant's brief filed on 972018 in urging the Court to allow the appeal. Afam Osigwe Esq., adopted and relied on the respondent's brief filed on 782018 in urging the Court to dismiss the appeal and affirm the concurrent findings of the two lower Courts.  The appellant distilled 4 issues for the determination of the appeal as follows: i. Whether the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal did not err in law in upholding the decision of the trial Court when they held that the trial Court had jurisdiction to entertain suit number HCFCTCV8492016. ii. Whether the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal were right in law in upholding the decision of the trial Court when they held that the amended originating motion dated 7th day of March, 2016 was accompanied with a statement as required by FREP Rules, 2009. iii. Whether the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal were right in law in upholding the decision of the trial Court when they held that the Appellant detained the Respondent for five weeks from 28122015 till 522016 when there was no shred of evidence at the trial Court and the lower Court to that effect. iv. Whether the learned trial Judge did not err in law when he acted on the amended originating motion filed on 7th March 2016 which formed the basis of his decision when the said amended originating motion was incompetent having been amended and filed without the leave of the Court.  The respondent also submitted 4 issues for determination thus: 1. Does the High Court of FCT have jurisdiction to entertain an application by Respondent for enforcement of fundamental rights against an agency of Federal Government of Nigeria? 2. Was Respondent's amended Originating Motion accompanied by with a Statement as required by the Fundamental Rights Enforcement Rules 2009? 3. Was the Court below not right in upholding the trial Court's finding that the Appellant arrested and detained Respondent from 281215 until 050216 a period of five weeks. 4. Was the trial Court not right in relying on the amended Originating Motion as the basis for its decision?  I shall utilise the issues formulated by the appellant for the resolution of the appeal.  The brief facts of the case, as pleaded by the respondent in his affidavit in support of his originating motion are as follows: That he is an Austrian national married to a Nigerian woman, and has lived in Nigeria for over 20 years. That he has taken up residency in the country and has his businesses investments here. That on 28th December, 2015, five men who identified themselves as operatives of the appellant, stormed his home and with a search warrant and informed him that his presence was required at the appellant's office in respect of an allegation of money laundering concerning contracts awarded to his companies by the office of the National Security Adviser. He denied any fraudulent dealing and informed the operatives that in fact he had outstanding payments due to him in respect of completed contracts, which had been verified by the office of the National Security Adviser. He averred that inspite of investigations which confirmed that there was no wrong doing on his part, the appellant ordered his detention at their facility on 28122015, where he remained without being charged to Court until 522016.  In the course of executing the search warrant in his home various documents belonging to his businesses, his international passport and items belonging to his wife and brother-in-law, such as their mobile phones, were confiscated. He averred that access to his bank accounts was restricted and he was placed on a watch list and no fly list. That the confiscation of his international passport and restriction of access to his bank accounts had damaged his reputation, affected his business and traumatised him.  As stated earlier, the appellant contended that the respondent was merely arrested for questioning following its investigation into the ill-fated arms deal by the office of the National Security Adviser, pursuant to which it was discovered that huge amounts of money were traced to companies in which the respondent is the alter ego. It denied detaining the respondent or confiscating his international passport.  Having stated the facts, I shall proceed to consider the issue for determination, I shall consider issues 1 and 4 first, as they raise the issue of the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the originating motion. Issues 2 and 3 will be considered thereafter.  Issue 1 Whether the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal did not err in law upholding the decision of the trial Court when they held that the trial Court had jurisdiction to entertain suit number HCFCTCV8492016.  It is the appellant's contention that the appellant, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission EFCC is an agent of the Federal Government, having been created by an Act of the National Assembly via the EFCC Establishment Act, 2004 and is charged with the responsibility of investigating all reported cases of economic and financial crimes in Nigeria. He referred to Sections 11and 6b and h of the Act.  He submitted that by the combined effect of Sections 251 and 257 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal High Court in the civil causes and matters set out in Section 2511atos thereof, which includes suits seeking to challenge the administration, management and control of the Federal Government or any of its agencies, or the operation and interpretation of the Constitution in so far as it affects the Federal Government or any of its agencies; or any action or injunction affecting the validity of any executive or administrative action or decision by the Federal Government or any of its agencies. He referred to Section 2511p,qandr.  He argued that a fundamental rights action seeking for declaratory reliefs for unlawful arrest and detention against the Federal Government or its agencies is an action \"affecting the validity of any executive or administrative action or decision by the Federal Government on any of its agencies.\" He argued that the suit falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court notwithstanding the provisions of Section 461and 2 and Section 2721 of the Constitution. He submitted that although by Section 461 of the Constitution, the State High Courts, the Federal High Court and the High Court of the FCT have concurrent jurisdiction in matters of enforcement of fundamental rights, they do not have concurrent jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter of the enforcement where it fails within the purview of Section 251 of the Constitution.  He submitted that the wide powers conferred on the High Courts vide Sections 462 and 2721 of the Constitution must be read subject to the provisions of Section 251 of the Constitution thereby limiting their powers to matters that do not fall within the purview of matters listed in Section 251 of the Constitution.  He referred to the case of Jack Vs University of Agriculture, Makurdi 2004 5 NWLR Pt. 865 208, wherein this Court held that the Federal High Court and the High Court of a State have concurrent jurisdiction in fundamental right enforcement cases but argued that the issue of the subject matter that led to the alleged breach was not raised or considered in that case. He submitted that in the instant case, the alleged breach, if established, was committed in the exercise of the appellant's executive or administrative duties. He referred to Adetona v. Igele General Enterprises Ltd. 2011 LPELR-159 SC, to the effect that when considering issues of jurisdiction, the territorial and subject matter jurisdiction of the Courts are relevant considerations. He relied on Minister of Internal Affairs v. Shugaba 1982 3 NCLR 915 and Tukur v. Government of Gongola State 1989 3 NSCC 256. He submitted that since the subject matter of the investigation that led to the alleged breach is money laundering, by Section 20 of the Money Laundering prohibition Act 2011 as amended, vests exclusive jurisdiction to try the offence on the Federal High Court. Relying on Madukolu v. Nkemdilim 1962 1 ALL NLR 587 @ 595, he submitted that jurisdiction is a threshhold issue and where the Court lacks jurisdiction, any act done would amount to a nullity. He also submitted that the issue of jurisdiction can be raised at any time. He cited the case of Bronik Motors Vs Wema Bank 1983 1 SC NLR 296 @ 310 B-C, in support.  Learned counsel for the respondent, in reaction, submitted that the appellant misconceived the effect of Sections 251 and 257 of the Constitution. He submitted that there is nothing in those sections which suggests that being an agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria, the appellant cannot be sued for the enforcement of fundamental rights in the High Court of the Federal capital Territory or the High Court of a state. He noted that the substance of the respondent's claim was his right to personal liberty and freedom of movement. He submitted that contrary to the appellant's contention, what the respondent was challenging was his detention by the appellant from 28122015 to 522016 and not the administration or management and control of the EFCC; nor the operation and interpretation of the Constitution as it affects the EFCC, nor is it seeking a declaration or injunction affecting the validity of any executive or administrative action or decision by the Commission.  He submitted that the learned appellant's counsel misconceived the decision of this Court in Jack v. University of Agriculture, Makurdi supra. He submitted that the Court took a holistic look at the entire Sub-sections of Section 251 of the Constitution before reaching its decision. He submitted that the case of Adetona v. Igele General Enterprises ltd supra is not apposite because it dealt with the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court vis a vis the High Court of a State and was not an action for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. He submitted further that Adetona did not consider or overrule the decision in Jack v. University of Agriculture supra. He noted that the appellant's contention that the provisions of Chapter IV of the Constitution are subject to Section 251 thereof, was considered and resolved in the negative in Jack's case.  Learned counsel submitted that even if he is wrong in the above submission, the respondent's suit did not challenge the validity of any executive or administrative action but merely sought to enforce the respondent's fundamental rights pursuant to Section 461 of the 1999 Constitution. He relied on the persuasive authority of the dictum of Affeni, J. in suit No. FCTHCCV257320I7: Bartholomew Ononmhen Asuelimen v. FCT delivered on 3042018, wherein similar postulations by the appellant were carefully considered and rejected.  On the contention that the subject matter of the suit is money laundering, learned counsel submitted that the Respondent did not invite the trial Court to consider and determine whether or not he committed the offence of money laundering and no such issue was tried by the Court. He referred to the finding of Agim, JCA on the point at page 305 of the record.  In determining this issue, I deem it necessary to set out the relevant provisions of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, for ease of reference. The Sections are: Sections 461, 2 and 3, Section 2721 and Section 2511 p q and r: \"461 Any person who alleges that any of the provisions of this Chapter has been, is being or is likely to be contravened in any State in relation to him may apply to a High Court for redress. 2 Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, a High Court shall have original jurisdiction to hear and determine any application made to it in pursuance of the provisions of this section and may make such orders, issue such writs and give such directions as it may consider appropriate for the purpose of enforcing or securing the enforcement within that state of any right to which the person who makes the application may be entitled under this chapter. 3 The Chief Justice of Nigeria may make rules with respect to the practice and procedure of a High Court for the purposes of this section.  2721 Subject to the provision of Section 251 and other provisions of this Constitution, the High Court of a State shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any civil proceedings in which the existence or extent of a legal right, power, duty, liability, privilege, interest, obligation or claim is in issue or to determine any criminal proceedings involving or relating to any penalty, forfeiture, punishment or other liability in respect of an offence by any person. 2511 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Constitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by an Act of the National Assembly, the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other Court in civil causes and matters relating to - p the administration or the management and control of the Federal Government or any of its agencies; q subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the operation and interpretation of this Constitution in so far as it affects the Federal Government or any of its agencies. r any action or proceeding for a declaration or injunction affecting the validity of any executive or administrative action or decision by the Federal Government or any of its agencies.\"  It is important to note that Chapter IV of the Constitution, which comprises Sections 33-46 sets out the various fundamental rights guaranteed to every citizen of Nigeria. These include the right to life Section 33, the right to dignity of the human person Section 34, the right to personal liberty Section 35, the right to fair hearing Section 36; and the right to freedom of movement Section 41, to name a few. As reproduced above, Section 461 provides that any person who alleges that any of the provisions of the Chapter i.e. Chapter IV has been, is being or is likely to be contravened in any State in relation to him, may apply to a High Court for redress. The High Courts are established by Section 249 - Federal High Court; 254A 1 - The National Industrial Court; the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory - Section 255 1; and the High Court of a state - Section 270 1. These Courts enjoy unlimited jurisdiction subject only to the provisions of Section 251 of the Constitution and any other provision thereof and in addition to such other jurisdiction as many be conferred upon them by law.  The meaning and nature of fundamental rights was explained by this Court in Chief Mrs. Olufunmilayo Ransome-Kuti & Ors. v. A.G Federation & Ors 1985 LPELR-2940 SC @ 33-34 B-C, where his Lordship Eso, J.S.C stated, inter alia: \"... what is the nature of a fundamental right? It is a right which stands above the ordinary laws of the land and which in fact, is antecedent to the political society itself. It is a primary condition to a civilized existence and what has been done by our Constitution since independence... up to the present Constitution... is to have these rights enshrined in the Constitution so that the rights would be \"immutable\" to the extent of the \"non-immutability\" of the constitution itself.\"  There is no doubt that by virtue of Section 2511 of the Constitution, the Federal High Court enjoys exclusive jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other Court in respect of the causes and matters enumerated in Sub-paragraphs a to s respectively. Sub-paragraphs p,q and r reproduced earlier are significant in this regard. It is not disputed that the Appellant, by virtue of the EFCC Establishment Act 2004 is an agency of the Federal Government.  It is also evident from Section 461 of the Constitution that a person seeking to enforce his fundamental rights may seek redress in any High Court. The question that arises is whether the nature of the respondent's claim before the trial Court has in any way restricted jurisdiction to hear it to the Federal High Court? It has been argued by learned counsel for the appellant that what should determine the Court's jurisdiction is the subject matter of the alleged breach, which in his view, relates to the administration or management and control of the appellant.  With the greatest respect to learned counsel, this is an erroneous conception of the import of Section 461 of the Constitution. The provisions are clear and should be given their natural and ordinary meaning. At the risk of repetition, it provides that any person who alleges that any of the provisions of Chapter IV of the Constitution has been, is being or is likely to be contravened in any state in relation to him, may apply to a High Court for redress.  A careful examination of the respondent's claim shows clearly that he is not challenging any administrative or executive act or the management and control of the appellant. He is alleging that his unlawful arrest and detention by the appellant constitutes a breach of his fundamental right to personal liberty guaranteed under Section 351 and 4 of the Constitution, his right to be notified in writing of any offence allegedly committed by him, guaranteed by Section 353 of the Constitution; his right to dignity guaranteed by Section 341 of the Constitution; and his right to property guaranteed by Section 43 of the Constitution.  In the case of Jack v. University of Agriculture, Makurdi 2004 1 SC Pt.1 100 @ 111-112, Section 461 of the 1999 Constitution was interpreted by this Court. Reference was made to the interpretation of Section 421 of the 1979 Constitution which is in pari materia with Section 461 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, which was considered in Bronik Motors Ltd. v. Wema Bank Ltd. 1983 1 SCNLR 296 AND Tukur v. Government of Gongola State 1989 9 SC 1; 1989 4 NWLR pt.117 517, to the effect that where both the State High Court and the Federal High Court exist in a State, they have concurrent jurisdiction in matters pertaining to fundamental rights.  His Lordship Uwaifo, J.S.C continued at page 111 Lines 21 to page 112 Lines 3 as follows: \"Section 421 is a special provision which deals with matters of fundamental rights. It confers jurisdiction on any High Court in a State in matters of fundamental rights irrespective of who is affected by an action founded on such rights. On the other hand, Section 230 1s of the 1979 Constitutionas amended is a general provision. The law is that where there is a special provision in a statute, a later general provision in a statute, a later general provision in the same statute capable of covering the same the same subject-matter is not to be interpreted as derogating from what has been specially provided for individually unless an intention to do so is unambiguously declared: See Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria v. Olloh 2002 4 S.C. Pt. II 117; 2002 9 NWLR 773 475 at 489. In my view, Section 421 is intended to give access to an aggrieved party to any High Court in a State where an alleged contravention of his fundamental right has taken place or is to take place, it is, therefore, a section which should itself be regarded as special and fundamental. The Court below was in error to hold that when a suit in respect of matters of fundamental right was brought against the Federal Government or any of its agencies, Section 2301 s of the 1979 Constitution as amended prevailed over Section 421.\"  This authority is a direct answer to the appellant's contention that the Federal High Court has exclusive jurisdiction to entertain the suit. The respondent's contention in his supporting affidavit is that he was unlawfully detained without being informed in writing of his alleged offence and without being charged before a competent Court. It therefore cannot be correct to contend, as learned counsel for the appellant has done, that the subject matter of the originating motion was money laundering.  I am of the view and I do hold that the decision of this Court in Jack v. University of Agriculture, Makurdi Supra and the authorities of Bronik Motors Ltd. v. Wema Bank Ltd and Tukur v. Government of Gongola State Supra represent the correct position of the law in this regard.  In a recent decision of this Court in Federal University of Technology Minna, Niger State & Ors v. Bukola Oluwaseun Olutayo 2017 LPELR-43827 SC @ 27-32 D-E, I expressed the following opinion: \"it is quite evident that Section 461 [of the 1999 Constitution, as amended] above refers to \"a High Court of a State\" without any restriction. The violation of a citizen's fundamental right is reviewed so seriously that the framers of the Constitution sought to ensure that no fetters are placed in the path of a citizen seeking to enforce his rights. In other words, the provision ensures that he has access to any High Court as long as it is within the State in which the alleged infraction occurred. Indeed it would negate the principle behind the guarantee if fundamental rights if a citizen were to have any obstacle placed in the path of enforcing those rights. There is no ambiguity in the provisions of the Constitution or of the fundamental rights Enforcement Procedure Rules... regarding which Court has jurisdiction to entertain an application for the enforcement of fundamental rights. The decision of this Court in Jack v. University of Agriculture Makurdi 2004 ALL FWLR pt.200 1506 @ 1518 B-D has put the matter to rest...\"  I adopt the view so expressed in the instant case. So long as the enforcement of the applicant's fundamental right is the main claim in the suit and not an ancillary claim, the Federal High Court and State High Courts, including the High Court of the FCT, have concurrent jurisdiction to entertain it. See: Tukur Vs Government of Gongola State Supra.  In light of all that I have said above, I find no merit in this issue. It is accordingly resolved against the appellant.  Issue 4 Whether the learned trial Judge did not err in law when he acted on the amended originating motion filed on 7th March 2016, which formed the basis of his decision when the said amended originating motion was incompetent, having been amended and filed without the leave of the Court.  I observe that by this issue, learned counsel for the appellant is attacking the decision of the learned trial Judge based on an amended originating motion purportedly filed without the leave of that Court. All the complaints under this issue relate to the proceedings of the trial Court. This Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain complaints arising from the decision of the trial Court. The appellate jurisdiction of this Court is limited by Section 2331 of the Constitution to hear and determine appeals from the Court of Appeal. In the circumstances, this issue is incompetent. It is hereby struck out.  Issue 2 Whether the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal were right in law in upholding the decision of the trial Court when they held that the amended originating motion dated 7th day of March, 2016 was accompanied with a statement as required by FREP Rules, 2009.  Learned counsel submitted that by Order II Rule 3 of the Fundamental Rights Enforcement procedure Rules 2009, it is mandatory that an applicant's originating motion shall be supported by a statement setting out the name and address of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds upon which the reliefs are sought. He submitted that the grounds upon which the reliefs are sough are not the same as the facts set out in the affidavit in support of the application and cannot be subsumed or incorporated in an affidavit. He submitted that the requirement for an affidavit in support of an originating motion is quite distinct and is an additional requirement to a statement in support of an originating motion. He submitted that non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of Order II Rule 3 and Order IX of the FREP Rules renders the suit a nullity or incompetent. He relied on Madukolu v. Nkemdilim Supra; Drexel Energy and Natural Resources Ltd. & Ors v. Trans International Bank & Ors. 2008 LPELR -962 SC @ 40-43 F-C.  In response, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that contrary to the appellant's contention, the provisions of Order II Rule 3 of the FREP Rules 2009 were duly comprised with. He submitted further that by virtue of Order IX Rule 1 wrongly stated as Order VI Rule 1, any non-compliance with the requirement as to time, place or manner or form shall be treated as an irregularity and may not nullify such proceedings except as they relate to i mode of commencement of the application and ii the subject matter is not within Chapter IV of the Constitution or the African Chapter on Human and Peoples Rights, Ratification and Enforcement Act. He referred to pages 59-61 of the record where the reliefs sought are set out in the statement under the caption. \"Facts upon which the reliefs are sought.\" He submitted that the grounds and facts relied on were incorporated by reference. On the principle of incorporation by reference, he referred to Black's Law Dictionary 8th edition page 781; Texaco Nig Plc v. Kehinde 2001 6 NWLR Pt. 781 244. He submitted that the two lower Courts were right in holding that there was compliance with the provisions of Order II Rule 3 of the FREP, 2009 Rules. He submitted that the reliance by the Court below on the principle of incorporation by reference is in line with the decision of this Court in Okomu Oil Palm Co. Ltd v. Iserhienrhien  2001 6 NWLR pt.710 660 @ 681. Referring to Articles 1 and 3f in the preamble to the Rules, learned counsel submitted that the Court is under an obligation to pursue the speedy and efficient enforcement and realisation of human rights in a manner calculated to advance Nigerian democracy, good governance, human rights and culture and that the Rules are for the purpose of advancing rather than restricting an applicant's rights and freedoms.  Learned counsel submits that the appellant's arguments are placing reliance on form and technicality to defeat the ends of justice. He cited several authorities in urging the Court to shun technicality in favour of substantial justice.  The finding of the lower Court in respect of this issue, which affirmed the decision of the trial Court, can be found at pages 317 - 320 of the record. I deem it necessary to reproduce the finding in some detail below: \"Since the affidavit in support of the Originating motion must contain the fact which support the application and the reliefs sought for therein, the facts therein would certainly not be different from the facts stated in the accompanying Statement as the grounds for the reliefs sought. The facts set out in the statement are usually a summary of the relevant facts that gave rise to the application. The said facts are more elaborately deposed to in the affidavits. It is for this reason that some applicants, instead of setting out the summary of the facts in the accompanying Statement, state therein their reliance on the facts in the supporting affidavit as the grounds for the reliefs sought.”  I agree that this practice that clearly would not prejudice the respondent in anyway satisfies the requirement of Order 2 Rule 3 of the Fundamental Right Enforcement procedure Rules 2009 that the grounds for the reliefs sought be set out in the Statement. By stating in the statement that \"facts upon which the reliefs sought are as elaborately stated in the affidavit in support of the application\", the said facts in the affidavit became incorporated in the said statement as the grounds for the reliefs sought.  Learned counsel for the respondent has correctly argued that this practice of incorporating into the contents of a document that is primarily in issue the contents of another document by simply relying on or referring to the contents of the second document as part of the documents primarily in issue is permitted by law. This practice, variously identified as incorporation by reference, incorporation and adoption by reference is the express inclusion in one document the contents of another document. This practice is restated in the 9th Edition of Black's Law Dictionary at page 834 thusly –  \"A method of making a secondary document part of a primary document by including in that primary document a Statement that the secondary document should be treated as if it were contained within the primary one..”  The application of this principle in Nigeria is judicially established and approved in a long line of cases including Iwuoha v. NRC Supra Okomu Oil Palm Co. Ltd v. Iserhienrhien supra Texaco Nig. Plc. v. Kehinde supra East Horizon Gas Co. Ltd & Ors v. Efiok & Ors. 2010 LPELR - 4066 CA, Obusez & Anor v. Obusez & Anor 2007 4 SC Pt. 11 28 Ekpemupolo & Ors. v. Edremoda & Ors. 2009 LPELR - 1089SC NNB Plc v. Owie 2010 LPELR - 4591 CA and Pt 290 698 at 714 - 715. The Supreme Court in Okomu Oil palm Co. Ltd.  v. Iserhienrhien  supra and in Ekpemupolo & Ors v. Edremoda & Ors. supra and this Court in Owena Bank Nig. Ltd. v. NSCC Ltd. supra laid down the law that the required content of a particular Court process prescribed by the relevant Rules of Court can be satisfied by incorporating into that process the content of another Court process in the same case. In these cases, the reliefs claimed for were not expressly set out in the Statement of Claim as required by the relevant Rules of Court, rather it was stated therein thusly \"where of the plaintiffs claim as per their writ of Summons.\" The Supreme Court in Ekpemupolo & Ors V, Edremoda & Ors Supra cited and followed its restatement in Okomu Oil palm Co. Ltd. v. Iserhienrhien supra that \"reference  in a Statement of claim to the writ for the reliefs claimed in the writ of summons makes the statement of claim complete as it incorporates the writ\" and approved and adopted the restatement of the Court in Owena Bank Nig, Ltd. v. NSCC thusly: \"where the Statement of claim states that the plaintiff claims \"as per writ of summons is incorporated in the statement of claim and becomes a part of it. Once there is such incorporation, the Statement of claim is taken to contain the relief stated in the writ which statement of claim would otherwise have been defective and contrary to the requirements of Order 13 Rule 7.\"  The Statement that accompanied the Originating motion, having incorporated into it the facts contained in the affidavit in support of the said motion as the grounds for the reliefs sought, clearly complied with the requirements of Order 2 Rule 3 of the Fundamental Rights Enforcement Procedure Rules 2009.\"  The above findings are unmissable. I endorse them in toto. The appellant has not shown that it has suffered a miscarriage of justice by the incorporation of the facts contained in the affidavit in support of the originating motion as grounds for the relief sought. This issue is accordingly resolved against the appellant.  Issue 3 Whether the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal were right in law in upholding the decision of the trial Court when they held that the appellant detained the respondent for five weeks from 28122015 till 522016 when there was no shred of evidence at the trial Court and the lower Court to that effect.  Learned counsel for the appellant argued that while the appellant did not deny arresting the respondent on 28122015 in connection with a case of money laundering, he was never detained. He submitted that notwithstanding its denial in its counter affidavit, the two lower Courts found and held that it unlawfully detained him without any evidence to that effect. He submitted that the onus was on the respondent to prove not only that it was the five operatives who went to his house that detained him but also that he was detained for the period alleged by CSPs Sharu and Madaki. He submitted further that there is no evidence that the respondent's international passport was confiscated. He submitted that there is no burden on the appellant to prove the negative and that it is only after the respondent has proved his allegation that the burden would shift to the appellant to prove otherwise. He referred to the case of Ohochukwu Vs A.G. Rivers State & Ors. 2012 LPELR -7849 SC @ 37E. He submitted that the two lower Courts wrongly placed the burden on the appellant to prove that it did not detain the respondent.  Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that there was sufficient evidence in the respondent's supporting affidavit to prove that his fundamental rights were breached by the appellant. He noted that the respondent filed a Reply to the appellant's counter affidavit wherein he deposed to the fact that his detention was widely reported in the print and news media and copies of the publications were attached thereto as exhibits. He submitted that the averments were not challenged. Similarly, the averment that it was not until his lawyer signed a bail bond for his release on 522016 that he was eventually released was also not denied. He submitted that in spite of being served with notice to produce, the appellant failed to produce the bail bond. He referred to other documents exhibited to the application which further established the fact of his detention.  Learned counsel noted that the lower could held that having admitted that it arrested the respondent on 28122015, the burden shifted to the appellant to show when he was released. He submitted that the weighty averments in the respondent's affidavit, not materially denied or challenged by the appellant, are deemed admitted.  The finding of the lower Court on this issue is at pages 328-332 of the record. Having regard to the soundness of the reasoning, I shall again reproduce same in detail hereunder: \"Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the appellant did not deny that it arrested the respondent and expressly admitted in the appellant's brief that the appellant arrested the respondent on 28122015 in connection with a case of money laundering but was not detained from 28122015 to 522016 or at all and that the respondent volunteered his Statement and was never detained. The primary legal duty of the respondent to prove his arrest and detention by the appellant became discharged upon the appellant's admission that it arrested the respondent on 28122015 in his residence, searched same and took him to its office. Upon that admission, to the evidential burden shifted to the appellant to show when it released the respondent after arresting and taking him to their office on 28122015. A suspect is detained immediately he or she is arrested and extends to his being taken into police or prison custody. This is because the arrest restrains his freedom of movement in any direction and freedom of choice of where to be and subjects him to the custody of those arresting him. S. 4 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 which provides for how an arrest is to be effected states that \"In making an arrest, the police officer or other persons making the arrest shall actually touch or confine the body of the suspect, unless there is a submission to the custody by word or action.\" So an admission that suspect was arrested, carries with it an admission that he was detained from the moment of the arrest and those who arrested him cannot validly argue that they did not detain him. What should be considered at this juncture is whether the appellants released the respondent and when the respondent was released. As I had held herein, the appellant who arrested him has the burden to prove that it released him and that it did so on a particular date. The appellant adduced no evidence to show the date he released the respondent after it arrested him. It did not in its counter-affidavit answer the deposition in paragraphs of 22 and 23 of the affidavits in support of the originating motion that the appellant continued to detain the respondent from 28122015, when it arrested him till 522016, when it released the respondent. Since the appellant did not adduce evidence of when it released the respondent, the respondent's deposition that after his arrest on 28122015, the appellant continued to detain him till 522016 when it released him, remained unchallenged and uncontradicted and thereby admitted. It clearly failed to discharge the burden on it to show when the respondent was released and did not contradict or [challenged] the respondent's deposition of that fact. When a party fails to contradict the evidence of the adverse party on a fact, he is deemed to have admitted such fact. Also uncontradicted evidence of a fact if credible must be accepted by the Court as establishing the truth of the fact alleged therein… The respondent deposed in paragraph 7 of his further affidavit filed on 21-3-2016 that \"I was not released by the respondent until my lawyer signed a bail bond for my release on Friday, February 5, 2016. The Respondent is hereby given notice to produce the bail bond signed by [my] lawyer, Mazi Afam Osigwe.\" The appellant did not file a further counter affidavit to deny this deposition and thereby admitted it failed to produce the said bail bond to show when it released the respondent on bail. The respondent in paragraphs 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 of the affidavits in support of the originating motion deposed that- \"30. Against all internationally acceptable best practice, the respondent's operatives refused to record all the items, like the two phones confiscated from my brother-in law were not recorded so that a proper record of the same will be signed and kept in the file. 31. The respondent wrote to my bank and restricted my access to my banks accounts. 32. The officials of the respondent who met with me only a few times were only interested in forcing me to admit that I laundered money and therefore agree to refund money to the Federal Government of Nigeria. 33. The respondent is still holding on to my international passport which its operatives confiscated when they came to my house, despite all requests and entreaties for the release of the same. 34. The confiscation of my international passport has made it extremely difficult for me to carry on my business which entails extensive international travels to attend meetings with business partners, conclude international and supervise and or co-ordinate projects in different cities of the world. 35. The respondent has placed me on a watch- list and on a no-fly list without justification. [I] have lived consistently in Nigeria for over twenty years and have in fact taken up residency here. 43. I am ready to face any charge that may ever be brought against me as i have committed no crime in respect of which I would live in fear or seek to abscond from Nigeria.\" The appellant's counter-affidavit did not respond to the above depositions that its officials who arrested the respondent confiscated and detained his international passport and other documents and have placed him on watch list and no fly list.  The counter affidavit is silent in the face of the said depositions. By not denying the said depositions, the appellant admitted them as true and correct. See Adesina v. The Commission, IfonIlobu Boundary Commission & Anor. supra Okoebor v. Police Council & Ors. supra and A.G Plateau State v. A.G Nasarawa State 2005 4 SC 58. So the respondent proved that appellant's officials confiscated his International passport and other documents and placed him on a watch-list and no-fly-list. For the above reasons, I hold that the trial Court was right when it held that the appellant detained the respondent from 28-12-2015 to 5-2-2016, seized his International passport and other documents and placed him on a watch-list and no-fly-list.\"  I cannot fault the above reasoning. The appellant has failed to satisfy me that the reasoning is perverse or that any special circumstances exist to warrant interference with the concurrent findings of the two lower Courts. This issue is accordingly resolved against the appellant.  Having resolved issues 1, 2 and 3 against the appellant and having struck out issue 4 for incompetence, I find no merit whatsoever in the appeal. It is hereby dismissed. The judgment of the lower Court is affirmed.  The respondent is entitled to the costs of the appeal, which I assess at N300,000 against the appellant.   OLUKAYODE ARIWOOLA, J.S.C.:  I had the opportunity of reading in draft the lead judgment of my learned brother, Rhodes-Vivour, J.S.C  just delivered. I am in agreement with the reasoning therein and conclusion arrived thereat, that the appeal is unmeritorious and should be dismissed. I too will dismiss the appeal.  I abide by the consequential orders including that on costs.  Appeal dismissed.   AMINA ADAMU AUGIE, J.S.C.:  I had a preview of the lead Judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Kekere-Ekun, JSC, and I do agree with him that this Appeal totally lacks merit, and must be dismissed. He dealt extensively and decisively with all the Issues raised in the Appeal, and anything I add would only detract from his sound reasoning, which I adopt as mine in its entirety, as they represent my views on all the Issues.  The end result is that I also dismiss this Appeal and affirm the Judgment of the Court of Appeal. I also abide by the consequential Orders he made in lead judgment, including the Order as to costs.   PAUL ADAMU GALUMJE, J.S.C.:  I have had the advantage of reading in draft, the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, KUDIRAT MOTONMORI OLATOKUNBO KEKERE-EKUN, J.S.C and I agree that this appeal has no merit and it is accordingly dismissed by me as well. The judgment of the lower Court is affirmed.   UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI, J.S.C.:  I was privileged to read in draft the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Kekere-Ekun, JSC. My learned brother considered the issues formulated for determination exhaustively and I agree without reservation with his reasoning and conclusion that the appeal lacks merit and is only good for the dustbin.  Being a concurrent decision, I wish not to disturb it. The appeal is similarly dismissed by me and the costs of N300,000 awarded to the Respondent is concurred to.-end!" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The respondent sued the appellant vide an Amended originating Motion seeking among others the following reliefs: 1.A declaration that the arrest, detention, restriction/confinement and continuing detention of the Applicant by the EFCC was unlawful, unconstitutional, illegal and violation of the Applicant's fundamental rights guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. 2.A Declaration that the refusal to release the Applicant until he admits laundering undisclosed amount of money or any sum whatsoever is unlawful, unconstitutional, illegal and a violation of the Applicant's Fundamental Rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. 3. An Order of injunction restraining the EFCC from violating or further violating the fundamental rights of the Applicant as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. 4. An order for the sum of Two Billion Naira (2,000,000,000) only as exemplary and aggravated damages for the infraction of the Applicant's fundamental rights. 5. An Order of Court for the release of the Applicant from custody of the EFCC; directing the EFCC to tender a public apology to the Applicant; immediate release of the Applicant's international passport confiscated by the EFCC. Upon being served with the process, the EFCC raised a preliminary objection to the hearing of the originating process on the grounds that the original originating motion was not served on it; and that the respondent failed to comply with the provisions of the Fundamental Rights (Enforcement procedure) Rules (FREP), 2009 relating to the mode of commencement of an action. In defence of the substantive application, the EFCC, filed a counter affidavit wherein it denied detaining the respondent or confiscating his international passport.  After listening to the parties, the trial Court, in a reserved judgment dismissed the EFCC’s preliminary objections and entered judgment in the substantive suit in the respondent's favour. It found and held that the EFCC unlawfully detained the respondent in its custody and also confiscated his international passport. The Court awarded N10 million (Ten Million Naira) as damages in favour of the respondent and against the appellant for unlawful detention.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  UGOCHUKWU ANTHONY OGAKWU, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  In the beginning, they were man and wife. It was his second marriage. The first wife had died in childbirth. So he married again. There was turbulence in the union. Their ship of marriage could not stay afloat in the stormy waters of matrimony. She commenced proceedings for the dissolution of the marriage in the Family Court Division, of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, County of Hennepin, State of Minnesota, United States of America. The marriage had lost its saltiness. It had become tasteless; the saltiness could not be restored. There was no longer light in the marriage; it had become the eyes of darkness. So, he did not contest the dissolution of the marriage. They entered into a Marital Termination Agreement, which in the Nigerian Judicial lingo will be termed Terms of Settlement. The Court entered judgment in terms of the Marital Termination Agreement. There was no plenary trial, no evidence was adduced. Their homestead at 4104 Lakeside Avenue, Brooklyn Center, Minnesota was awarded to her exclusively. But it did not end there.  There is a property in Nigeria. It is situate at No. 12, Femi Akinfolarin Street, off Association Avenue Road, Ikotun, Lagos. She commenced proceedings in the High Court of Lagos State in respect of the said property. The proceedings were in SUIT NO. ID12072012: FLORENCE AUSTIN vs. MR. GRANT KAYODE YANKEY. The Respondent herein, was the Claimant in the action. She claimed the following reliefs against the Appellant herein as Defendant: “a A Declaration that the Claimant is entitled with the Defendant to equal share of the property lying, being and situate at No 12, Femi Akinfolarin Street, Off Association Avenue Road, Ikotun Lagos State and covered by Certificate of Occupancy dated 21st day of August, 1990 and registered as 55551990Y, in the Land Registry at Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos State, containing 2 Wings of 8 Bedroom duplex each and its appurtenances thereof. b An Order of Court partitioning equally the property lying, being and situate at No. 12, Femi Akinfolarin Street, Off Association Avenue Road, Ikotun Lagos State and covered by Certificate of Occupancy dated 21st day of August, 1990 and registered as 55551990Y, in the Land Registry at Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos State, containing 2 Wings of 8 Bedroom duplex each and its appurtenances thereof between the Claimant and the Defendant herein. c An Order of Court that the Claimant is entitled to 1 Wing 8 Bedroom Duplex together with its appurtenances, being half of the property lying, being and situate at 12, Femi Akinfolarin Street, Off Association Avenue Road, Ikotun Lagos State and covered by Certificate of Occupancy dated 21st day of August, 1990 and registered as 55551990Y, in the Land Registry at Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos State, containing 2 Wings of 8 Bedroom duplex each and its appurtenances. d An order of Court mandating the Defendant to do all that may be required legally to enable the Claimant perfect her title to the 1 wing 8 Bedroom Duplex together with its appurtenances, being half of the property lying, being and situate at No. 12, Femi Akinfolarin Street, Off Association Avenue Road, Ikotun Lagos State and covered by Certificate of Occupancy dated 21st day of August, 1990 and registered as 55551990Y, in the Land Registry at Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos State.” See pages 79-80 of the Records  Issues were joined on the pleadings filed and exchanged by the parties. The matter was subjected to a full dressed hearing. Testimonial and documentary evidence was adduced. In its judgment the lower Court, Coram Judice: Akinkugbe, J. entered judgment in her favour. All the reliefs claimed were granted. He was dissatisfied with the decision. He appealed against the same. So here we are. The judgment of the lower Court which was delivered on 27th May 2016 is at pages 221-233 of the Records. The Notice of Appeal which was filed on 27th July 2016 is at pages 237-242 of the Records. The Records of Appeal were compiled and transmitted and briefs of argument were filed and exchanged.  The Appellant’s brief was filed on 23rd September 2016. Two issues were therein distilled for determination, namely: “WHETHER a Court in the United States of America has the prerequisite jurisdiction to make an order affecting a property situate in Lagos, especially when there was no claim in respect of the property before it. Distilled from grounds i & iii of the Notice of Appeal dated 27th July, 2016. WHETHER the Court below was right in granting the reliefs sought by the Respondent having regards to the law and the preponderance of evidence before the Honourable Court. Distilled from grounds ii, iv & v of the Notice of Appeal dated 27th July, 2016.”  The Respondent’s Brief was filed on 11th January 2017. The issues formulated by the Appellant were adopted by the Respondent. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned counsel for the parties urged the Court to uphold their respective submissions in the determination of the appeal. I will presently review the submissions of learned counsel and thereafter resolve the appeal seamlessly en bloc based on the issues distilled.  SUBMISSIONS OF LEARNED COUNSEL The Appellant submits that the United States Court did not have the jurisdictional competence to adjudicate in respect of the property situate in Lagos, Nigeria as the subject matter was not within its jurisdiction and also on the principle of lex situs. The cases of MADUKOLU vs. NKEMDILIM 1962 1 ALL NLR 587, AMAECHI vs. INEC 2007 9 NWLR PT 1040 504, NDAEYO vs. OGUNAYA 1997 NSCC 5 among other cases were referred to. It was further stated that in the action in the United States, no reference was made to the property in Lagos and that a Court lacks power to grant a relief not sought for and therefore any order in respect of the property in the judgment of the United States Court is null and void and of no effect vide ADENUGA vs. ODUMERU 2001 1 SC 72, AGBI vs. OGBEH 2006 11 NWLR PT 990 65 and N. A. F. vs. SHEKETE 2002 12 SC PT II 52.  It was contended that the Respondent had the burden of proving that the Lagos property is joint property as contended by her but that she failed to discharge the burden. It was maintained that the Marital Termination Agreement was made for the purpose of entering a consent judgment in the proceedings in the United States and ought to be confined to the facts pleaded and reliefs claimed in the said proceedings. It was asserted that the Marital Termination Agreement never stated that the Lagos property was the joint property of the parties. It was further argued that the Respondent’s main relief was for a declaration in respect of the Lagos property and that the Respondent had the onus of leading positive evidence to establish her entitlement to the declaration sought, since the declaration is not to be granted based on admission. The cases of SORUNGBE vs. MOTUNWASE 1988 3 NCCC VOL. 19 252, DANTATA vs. MOHAMMED 2000 5 SC 1, SPRING BANK PLC vs. ADEKUNLE 2011 1 NWLR PT 1229 581 and BELLO vs. EWEKA 1981 1 SC 101 were relied upon.  The Appellant opined that the lower Court did not properly evaluate the evidence and ascribe probative value thereto and consequently meted out injustice to the Appellant, thereby making it appropriate for an appellate Court to interfere. The case of OWODUNNI vs. C.C. C. 2000 6 SC PT III 60 was called in aid. It was stated that where the declaration sought fails, the ancillary orders sought would perforce equally be refused vide SKENCONSULT vs. UKEY 1981 NSCC VOL. 12 1, MACFOY vs. UAC LTD 1962 AC 152 and UBA vs. ETIABA 2013 Q.R.R. 245. It was posited that there had been no previous litigation between the parties in respect of the Lagos property and that the rebuttable presumption afforded by the certificate of occupancy that the Appellant was the sole owner of the Lagos property was not rebutted. The case of DABO vs. ABDULLAHI 2005 5 MJSC 57 was cited in support. It was conclusively submitted that when the evidence is properly put on the imaginary scale of justice, it tilted heavily in favour of the Appellant such that judgment should have been entered in favour of the Appellant. The case of MOGAJI vs. ODOFIN 1978 NSCC VOL 11 278 was relied upon.  In her submission, the Respondent concedes that the United States Court would not have jurisdiction to adjudicate in a matter on the ownership of the Lagos property; but that what was before the Court was a claim for dissolution of marriage, awarding the property in the United States to the Respondent and for such further order or relief as the Court may deem fit to make in the circumstance, which were all granted by the United States Court thereby creating res judicata vide HENDERSON vs. HENDERSON 1843 67 ER 313 at 317 and HOYSTEAD vs. COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION 1926 AC 155 at 170. It was stated that the parties voluntarily agreed on the Marital Termination Agreement which was entered as judgment by the United States Court and that the parties cannot renege on the same. The case of SHELL PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT COMPANY NIG LTD vs. X. M. FEDERAL LTD 2006 27 NSCQR 127 at 141 was referred to.  The Respondent asserted that the issue of ownership of the Lagos property was one of the issues canvassed and agreed upon in the proceedings in the United States and that there was no appeal therefrom. The Respondent, it was stated, only resorted to litigation when the Appellant did not show any interest in the distribution of the Lagos property as determined by the Court.  The contention of the Respondent on the second issue is that the Marital Termination Agreement and the judgment of the United States Court raise the doctrine of issue estoppel as it relates to the Lagos property and that there was no need for the Respondent to prove what has already been established, id est, that the Lagos property is the joint property of the parties. The case of OGHOYONE vs. OGHOYONE 2013 3 SMC 299 was called in aid. It was conclusively submitted that based on the preponderance of evidence and the law, the lower Court was right in granting the reliefs claimed by the Respondent.  RESOLUTION By way of exordial, I stated the provenance of this matter. The key documentary evidence which are indispensable to the resolution of this matter are the Marital Termination Agreement, which was tendered as Exhibit FA1, the judgment of the United States Court, Exhibit FA2 and the Petition for the dissolution of the parties marriage, Exhibit FA6. It is these documents that afford the linchpin to the resolution of this matter. I have already set out the reliefs claimed by the Respondent at the lower Court. The principal relief sought is the declaration that she is entitled to equal share in the Lagos property. The action was fought on pleadings wherein issues were joined. The Respondent pleaded the facts in respect of her entitlement to equal share in the Lagos property in paragraph 3 of the Amended Statement of Claim, where it is averred as follows: “3. The Claimant avers that pursuant to the said Marital Termination Agreement and the judgment entered thereof on the property lying, being and situate at No. 12, Femi Akinfolarin Street, Off Association Avenue Road, Ikotun Lagos and covered by Certificate of Occupancy dated the 21st day of August, 1990 and registered as 55551990Y, in the Land Registry at Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos State, was adjudged to be the joint property of the claimant and the Defendant, whose distribution was reserved to be decided in accordance with Nigeria law. The claimant shall rely on the said Certificate of Occupancy at the trial of this suit.” See page 78 of the Records  Further, in paragraphs 2, 3 & 4 of the Reply to the Statement of Defence the Respondent averred thus: “2. The claimant deny the facts stated in paragraphs 7,13, 15,16,17, 18, 23 and 24 of the statement of defence and specifically contend that all issues except issues of distribution with regard to ownership of the property now known as 12, Femi Akinfolarin Street, Off Association Avenue Road, Ikotun Lagos State and covered by Certificate of Occupancy dated 21st day of August, 1990 and registered as 55551990Y, in the Land Registry at Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos State except issue of distribution has been concluded by the Marital termination agreement, findings of facts, conclusions of laws, order for judgement, and judgement and decree of dissolution of marriage dated the 16th day of January, 2001, in the District Court of the State of Minnesota, County of Hennepin, Fourth Judicial District, Family Court Division, United States of America and same cannot be re-opened again. 3. The claimant will contend at the trial that ownership of property now known and address as 12, Femi Akinfolarin Street, off Association avenue road, Ikotun Lagos State and covered by Certificate of Occupancy dated 21st day of August, 1990 and registered as 55551990Y, in the Land Registry at Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos State was made an issue in Court before the Marital termination agreement, findings of facts, conclusions of law, order for judgment, and judgment and decree of dissolution of marriage dated the 16th day of January, 2001, in the District Court of the State of Minnesota, County of Hennepin, Fourth Judicial District, Family Court Division, United States of America were arrived at. The claimant herein shall rely on copy of claimant solicitor’s letter interrogatories dated January, 26th 2000 and addressed to the Defendant Solicitor. 4. The claimant will contend at the trial that the only issue left unresolved by the Court is the issue of distribution of the real property adjudged to be jointly owned by the claimant and defendant.” See pages 117-118 of the Records  The Appellant in his Statement of Defence joined issues with the Respondent and averred as follows in paragraphs 13, 14, 15 and 18: “13. The Defendant avers that sometime in 1973 he purchased a piece of land at Ikotun, Lagos State for the sum of Three Thousand Naira from one Alhaji Raufu Lawal. Attached herewith and marked Annextures GKY 4 and GKY 5 are copies of the Purchase Receipt and Deed of Lease respectively. 14. The Defendant avers that Certificate of Occupancy No 55551990Y covering the said land has been issued to him by the Governor of Lagos State. A copy thereof is attached herewith and marked Annexture GKY 6. 15. The Defendant avers that the subject property was purchased before he met and married the Claimant, and that the Claimant made no contribution whatsoever towards the development of the same. Attached herewith and marked Annextures GKY 7, GKY 8, GKY 9 and GKY 10 are copies of Lagos State Government Treasury Receipt No. 150433 dated 192000 and Revenue Receipt No. 201330198152 dated 190413, Receipt of payment issued by NEPA dated 020305 and QuotationReceipt dated 061204 from Doak Alumetal Products espectively. 18. In specific response to the averment contained in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Statement of Claim the Defendant avers that in Petition No. DW 251235 before the District Court of the State of Minnesota, County of Hennepin the Claimant made no claims in respect of the subject property and the same was not adjudged to be the joint property of the Claimant and the Defendant in the judgment of 16th January, 2001 or in any orders made in the course of the proceedings.”  From the joinder of issues, it is clear that the parties were in the cross hairs as to whether the Lagos property was an issue before the United States Court and whether the Lagos property was adjudged to be jointly owned by the parties based on the finding of facts made by the United States Court. Let me hasten to iterate that there was no trial in the proceedings in the United States Court, no evidence was led, so any findings of facts made by the United States Court would necessarily derive from the Petition filed before it, Exhibit FA6 and the Marital Termination Agreement, Exhibit FA1.  In holding that the Lagos property was the joint property of the parties, the lower Court reasoned as follows at pages 230 of the Records: “I find and hold in view of the foregoing extracts of Exhibits FA1 and FA2 as reproduced above, that the defendant had agreed that he and the claimant are joint owners of the property at Ikotun and that by reserving the distribution for the Nigerian Courts to be adjudicated upon in Nigeria means that the Nigerian Courts would act on the binding agreement of parties which forms the basis of the judgment. I do not agree with submissions of the defendant’s counsel that the terms adjudication should be translated to mean what would amount to re-litigation in respect of the ownership of the property. The ownership of the property I find and hold has been settled by paragraph VII of Exhibit FA2.”  It continued and stated thus at page 232 of the Records: “However in this instant case I find as stated above that the Judgment is quite clear on the consent of parties and the pronouncement that it is a joint property. On that basis I find that the issue of contributions of parties is not a fact in issue. I find that the issue of contributions made by the claimant in the course of the marriage do not hold any weight here in view of the consent of parties that the property in issues is jointly owned...”  The lower Court from the periscope above arrived at its decision based on its interpretation of Exhibits FA1 and FA2, having at page 229 of the Records held that it would not ascribe much weight to Exhibit FA6, the Petition for dissolution of marriage which, in fact, spawned Exhibits FA1 and FA2. Hear the lower Court at page 229 of the Records: “I have looked carefully at all the exhibits especially Exhibits FA1, the Marital Termination Agreement and Exhibit FA2 which comprises of the Findings Of Fact, Conclusions Of Law, Order For Judgment And Judgment And Decree Of Dissolution as well as Exhibit FA6, the Petition For Dissolution of Marriage filed by the claimant. Exhibit FA6 as stated above is the petition no DW 2511235 on the 8th of September 1999 by the claimant in the District Court Fourth Judicial District, Family Court Division, County of Hennepin USA instituting the divorce that led to the eventual dissolution of the marriage between the parties. While it is correct to state as submitted by the defendant’s counsel that the said document did not refer to the property in Ikotun I find that although it is a precursor to Exhibits FA1 and FA2 it is not part of the Judgment of Judgment of dissolution of the marriage and I can therefore not ascribe much weight to it. All it does I find is to establish that CW1 was the one who filed the petition of divorce.”  So for the lower Court all Exhibit FA6 does is show that the Respondent filed the petition for divorce.  Now, it is rudimentary law that the issues in an action are ascertained and based on the pleadings; so it is the Petition, Exhibit FA6, that would show the issues that were before the United States Court. In my deferential view, the lower Court was wrong to treat the Petition, Exhibit FA6, as merely showing that it was the Respondent that filed for divorce. No. Exhibit FA6, more importantly, showed the issues that were before the United States Court. In DALEK NIG LTD vs. OMPADEC 2007 LPELR 916 1 at 32, Onnoghen, JSC, later CJN stated: “It is very important to note that it is settled law that in an action based on pleadings, issues are joined by the parties on the pleadings, issues are joined by the parties on the pleadings. It is also settled law that evidence on facts not pleaded go to on issue.”  Issues are joined on the pleadings, not in the evidence: BAMGBOYE vs. UNILORIN 1999 LPELR 737 1 at 30-31, LONGE vs. FBN PLC 2010 LPELR 1793 1 at 23, LEWIS & PEAT NRI LTD vs. AKHIMIEN 1976 7 SC 157 and ATOLAGBE vs. SHORUN 1985 1 NWLR PT 2 360 at 367. It is equally hornbook law that in the determination of disputes between parties in Court, the decision must be confined to the issues properly raised by the parties. When an issue is not properly placed before the Court, the Court has no business whatsoever to deal with it. See OSOLU vs. OSOLU 2003 SCNJ 162 and BANKOLE vs. DENAPO 2019 LPELR 46444 1 at 35-36. An issue not raised before a Court is not a subject matter for adjudication before the Court:LEWIS & PEAT NRI LTD vs. AKHIMIEN supra at 169, R. LAUWERS IMPORT-EXPORT vs. JOZEBSON INDUSTRIES COMPANY LTD 1988 LPELR 2934 1 at 40-41 and EJINDU vs. OBI 1997 LPELR 1066 1 at 18.  In order to ascertain the issues that were before the United States Court, I will set out the Respondents’ Petition, Exhibit FA6, verbatim ac literatim. It reads: “In Re the Marriage of:  Florence O. Yankey - Petitioner,            and                           Grant K. Yankey  - Respondent.  PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE Petitioner alleges and represents to the Court the following: 1. Petitioner’s full name is Florence O. Yankey who resides at 4104 Lakeside Avenue, Hennepin County, Minnesota 55429 Petitioner’s attorney is Loveday E. Ekeh. 2. Respondent’s full name is Grant K. Yankey who resides at 1420 Portland Avenue, South, Apartment 307, Hennepin County, Minnesota 55404. 3. Petitioner was born April 27, 1953 and is 46 years of age; respondent was born May 4, 1936 and is 63 years of age. 4. Petitioner’s social security number is … Respondent’s social security number is unknown. 5. Petitioner and respondent were married to each other in Lagos, Nigeria on May 13, 1975, and have been husband and wife ever since. 6. Petitioner has been a resident of the State of Minnesota for more than 180 days immediately preceding the commencement of this action. 7. There are no children born of this marriage who are currently minors. 8. Petitioner is not now pregnant. 9. The parties own real property located at 4104 Lakeside Avenue, Brooklyn Center, Hennepin County, Minnesota, and legally described as: Lot 001, Block 001, Dover’s Lakeview Addition. 10. There has been an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage relationship between petitioner and respondent pursuant to Minnesota Statutes Annotated 518.06, as amended. 11. Petitioner knows of no separate proceeding for dissolution of marriage which has been commenced by respondent and is currently pending in any court in this state or elsewhere. WHEREFORE, the petitioner prays for an Order of this Court as follows: 1. Granting a dissolution of the marriage relationship between petitioner and respondent. 2. Awarding petitioner the real property located at 4104 Lakeside Avenue, Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, and legally described as: Lot 001, Block 001, Dover’s Lakeview Addition. 3. For such other relief as the Court may deem just and equitable.”  It is effulgent that there is no mention whatsoever of the Lagos property in Exhibit FA6, whether as a jointly-owned property, as a property acquired in the course of the marriage or as a property available in the course of settlement of the property of the parties to the marriage. Pungently, there was no such issue before the United States Court. The Appellant’s contention on the principle of lex situs and the jurisdictional competence of a Court to adjudicate on subject matter of a case within its jurisdiction is good law, but there was no issue raised in the pleadings before the United States Court on the subject matter of the Lagos property and it therefore could not have adjudicated on the same. But did it?  The Respondent argued, and the lower Court agreed with her, that Exhibit FA1, the Marital Termination Agreement, which the United States Court entered as judgment in Exhibit FA2, adjudged the Lagos property to be joint property and for the same to be reserved for distribution for adjudication in a Court in Lagos State. At the expense of prolixity, I restate that issue of the Lagos property was not before the United States Court. The Respondent however argued that part of the reliefs before the lower Court and in respect of which judgment was entered was the relief “for such other relief as the Court may deem just and equitable”. By all odds, a Court can grant a consequential order in order to give effect to its judgment. It is a relief granted as incidental to the main relief. It is inconceivable and incomprehensible how an issue that was not in the pleadings before the Court can ground a consequential relief in the circumstances of this matter. See AWONIYI vs. REGD TRUSTEES OF AMORC 2000 LPELR 655 1 at 20-21, OBAYAGBONA vs. OBAZEE 1972 LPELR 2159 1 at 7-8, EZE vs. GOVERNOR OF ABIA STATE 2014 7 SCNJ 38 at 57 and 60 and NOEKOER vs. EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR OF PLATEAU STATE 2018 LPELR 43350 1 at 41-42.  Let us turn to the Marital Termination Agreement, Exhibit FA1, which the lower Court stated as showing that the Lagos property was their jointly-owned property. Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the said Exhibit FA1 are relevant. They read: “HOMESTEAD: 6. Petitioner shall receive all right, title, and interest to the homestead of the parties located at 4104 Lakeside Avenue, Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, and legally described as follows: Lot 001, Block 001, Dover’s Lakeview Addition. Petitioner will indemnify and hold harmless Respondent from any responsibility for any mortgage payments, tax payments, insurance payments, and any other expenses or liabilities associated with the homestead. Respondent shall forthwith execute a quit claim deed conveying his interest in said homestead to the petitioner. OTHER REAL PROPERTIES 7. That Petitioner and Respondent shall reserve the distribution of the property located at Ikotun Village, Mushin Local Government Area, Lagos State, Nigeria, No. 555519907, Area 1532.558 Square Meters, for adjudication in a Court in Lagos State, Nigeria. This Court is divested from having jurisdiction over the distribution of said property located in Nigeria.”  The words used in Exhibit FA1 are clear and unambiguous; the law is that being clear and unambiguous, they are to be given their plain, ordinary and natural meaning: AMIZU vs. NZERIBE 1989 4 NWLR PT 118 755, ADETOUN OLADEJI vs. NIGERIAN BREWERIES PLC 2007 LPELR 160 1 at 14, CITY ENGINEERING NIG LTD vs. FHA 1997 LPELR 868 1 at 42, LEWIS vs. UBA 2016 LPELR 40661 1 at 25, HOME PAGE INDUSTRIES LTD vs. TNT COURIER SERVICES LTD 2018 LPELR 45117 1 at 12-15 and SHEDOWO vs. A-G LAGOS STATE 2019 LPELR 46886 1 at 15-16. There is nothing, when the afore-stated paragraph 7 of Exhibit FA1 is given its plain and ordinary meaning, which would conduce to a construction that it was therein agreed that the Lagos property was jointly-owned by the parties. The stipulation in paragraph 6 of Exhibit FA1 for the Appellant to execute a deed conveying his interest in the United States property which was in issue in the Petition Exhibit FA6 shows that the said property was jointly-owned; there is nothing in respect of the Lagos property which I iterate was not in issue before the United States Court on the basis of which it can be concluded that it was jointly-owned. The distribution of the Lagos property was reserved for adjudication in a Court in Nigeria.  It is further based on the findings of facts and conclusions of law made by the United States Court in its decision, Exhibit FA2, that the lower Court held that the parties were joint owners of the Lagos property. Exhibit FA2 the decision of the United States Court, is predicated on the Marital Termination Agreement, Exhibit FA1. There was no trial before the United States Court, the parties having agreed for the Petition for dissolution of their marriage to be granted by default. As I have already demonstrated, there is nothing in Exhibit FA1 to the effect that it was agreed that the Lagos property was jointly-owned. The findings of facts of the United Stated Court in paragraph VII of Exhibit FA2, that the parties own real property in Lagos, going by the stipulations of paragraph 7 of Exhibit FA1, the Marital Termination Agreement, does not equate to a finding of fact on joint ownership of the Lagos property, in the light of the fact that the Lagos property was not an issue before it and it could therefore not adjudicate upon the same, coupled with the fact that even if it was an issue before it, it could not have adjudicated upon the same based on the principle of lex situs and the fact that the subject matter was not within its jurisdiction. The same applies with equal force to the conclusion of law that the distribution of the property is to be adjudicated in Lagos, even having conceded that it had no jurisdiction in respect of property in Nigeria. It is my respectful view in the light of the foregoing that it is a mis-appreciation and mis-apprehension of the issues before the United States Court and the thrust of Exhibits FA1 and FA2, which must ineluctably be confined to the issues before the United States Court, for the lower Court to have held that the ownership of the Lagos property had been settled by Exhibit FA2 and that it is clear on the consent of the parties and the pronouncement that the Lagos property is a joint property.  Exhibits FA1, FA2, and FA6 were in evidence before the lower Court. It is the trial Court that has the duty of evaluation of evidence and ascription of probative value thereto. There is a duty on the trial Court to receive all available relevant evidence on an issue. This is perception of evidence. After that there is another duty to weigh that evidence in the context of the surrounding circumstances of the case. This is evaluation of evidence. A finding of fact will entail both perception and evaluation. See OLUFOSOYE vs. OLORUNFEMI 1989 1 SC PT I 29 or 1989 LPELR 2615 1 at 9, GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER LTD vs. AJEH 2011 10 NWLR PT 1255 574 at 592 and WACHUKWU vs. OWUNWANNE 2011 LPELR 3466 1 at 50-51.  There is little or no difficulty with perception of evidence, id est, receive all available relevant evidence. Evaluation of evidence on the other hand is basically the assessment of the facts by the trial Court to ascertain which of the parties to a case before it has more preponderant evidence to sustain his claim. See ONWUKA vs. EDIALA 1989 1 NWLR PT 96 182 at 208-209, OYADIJI vs. OLANIYI 2005 5 NWLR PT 919 561 and AMEYO vs. OYEWOLE 2008 LPELR 3768 1 at 9. The evaluation involves a reasoned belief of the evidence of one of the contending parties and disbelief of the other or a reasoned preference of one version to the other. A Court of trial has the duty to consider the evidence adduced in respect of any facts on which issues were joined, decide which evidence to prefer on the basis of how the evidence preponderates and then make logical and consequential findings of facts. See ADEYEYE vs. AJIBOYE 1987 1 NWLR PT 61 432 at 451 and STEPHEN vs. THE STATE 1986 5 NWLR PT 46 978 at 1005.  The settled legal position is that where a trial Court unquestionably evaluates and justifiably appraises the facts, it is not the business of an appellate Court to substitute its own views for the views of the trial Court, however, an appellate Court can intervene where there is insufficient evidence to sustain the judgment; or where the trial Court fails to make proper use of the opportunity of seeing, hearing, and observing the witnesses; or where the findings of facts by the trial Court cannot be regarded as resulting from the evidence or where the trial Court has drawn wrong conclusions from accepted evidence or has taken an erroneous view of the evidence adduced before it or its findings are perverse in the sense that they do not flow from accepted evidence or not supported by the evidence before the Court. See FHA vs OLAYEMI  2017 LPELR 43376 1 at 69-71, EDJEKPO vs. OSIA 2007 8 NWLR PT 1037 635 or 2007 LPELR 1014 1 at 46-47, ARE vs. IPAYE 1990 LPELR 541 1 at 22, WOLUCHEM vs. GUDI 1981 5 SC 291 at 320 and FASIKUN II vs. OLURONKE II 1999 2 NWLR PT589 1 or 1999 LPELR 1248 1 at 47-48.  The decision of the lower Court to close its eyes to and shut out the evidence afforded by Exhibit FA6 and merely treat it as showing that the Respondent filed a Petition for divorce impacted on the lower court drawing wrong conclusions from the evidence and making findings of facts that do not result from the evidence. If the lower court had ascribed due probative value to Exhibit FA6, it would have been apparent to it that the Lagos property, on the pleadings, was not an issue before the United States Court and not being an issue, the United States Court could not have validly adjudicated on or made any findings or orders in respect thereof. Indubitably, having taken an erroneous view of the evidence, the findings which the lower Court arrived at are perverse as they do not flow from and are not supported by the evidence on record. In such circumstance, the lower Court having failed to properly evaluate the evidence, an appellate Court is duty bound to intervene and set aside the perverse findings in order to obviate miscarriage of justice: SAPO vs SUNMONU  2010 LPELR 3015 1 at 54-55, ATOLAGBE vs. SHORUN 1985 1 NWLR PT 2 360 and ABISI vs. EKWEALOR 1993 LPELR 44 1 at 51-55. Where there has been non-evaluation of evidence, like in this matter where the lower Court failed to put Exhibit FA6 on the imaginary scale of justice, or improper evaluation of evidence, as in this case where there is a misapprehension and mis-appreciation by the lower Court of the effect of Exhibits FA1 and FA2; and the question of evaluation of evidence not involving the credibility of witnesses, the appellate Court is in as good a position as the Court of trial to evaluate the evidence: NARUMAL & SONS NIG LTD vs. NIGER BENUE TRANSPORT COMPANY LTD 1989 2 NWLR PT 106 730 at 742 and ABISI vs. EKWEALOR supra at 52-53.  The Respondent’s claim before the lower Court is anchored on the facts averred to in paragraph 3 of the Amended Statement of Claim and paragraphs 2, 3 & 4 of the Reply to the Statement of Defence, which I have already reproduced in this judgment, to the effect that the Lagos property was made an issue in the United States Court and was adjudged to be jointly owned. I have held that the findings of the lower Court that the Lagos property was adjudged to be joint property by the United States Court is perverse and is not borne out by the evidence on record and it is in consequence set aside. The concomitance is that the Respondent did not establish and prove her entitlement to the reliefs claimed on the preponderance of evidence and balance of probability. The lower Court therefore arrived at the wrong decision when it entered judgment in favour of the Respondent. In order for the Respondent to be entitled to any share of the Lagos property, it has to be established that the property was joint property. This, the Respondent failed to do. In a summation, this appeal is meritorious and it succeeds. The appeal is allowed and the judgment of the High Court of Lagos State in SUIT NO. ID12072012 delivered on 27th May 2016 is hereby set aside. In its stead, an order of dismissal of the said action in its entirety is hereby made. The Appellant is entitled to the costs of this appeal which I assess and fix at N300, 000.00.   MOHAMMED LAWAL GARBA, J.C.A.:  My learned brother Ugochukwu Anthony Ogakwu, JCA., has lucidly considered the crucial issues which call for decision in this appeal. In the lead judgement which I read before now, His Lordship has comprehensively dealt with the material points in appeal leaving no gaps to be filled and so I agree that the appeal for the reasons set out therein, deserves to succeed and be allowed.  I join in allowing the appeal in terms of the lead judgement.   JAMILU YAMMAMA TUKUR, J.C.A.:  My learned brother UGOCHUKWU ANTHONY OGAKWU JCA afforded me the opportunity of reading in draft before today the Judgment just delivered and I agree with the reasoning and conclusion contained therein, adopt the Judgment as mine with nothing further to add.-end!

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  Appellant got married to the Respondent after his first wife died in childbirth. However, the Respondent later commenced proceedings for the dissolution of the marriage in the Family Court Division, of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, County of Hennepin, State of Minnesota, United States of America. Appellant did not contest the dissolution of the marriage allowing for both parties to enter into a Marital Termination Agreement (Terms of Settlement). The US Court adopted the Agreement as its judgment ensuring that there was no plenary trial, and that no evidence was adduced. As part of the agreement, the couple’s homestead at 4104 Lakeside Avenue, Brooklyn Center, Minnesota was awarded to Respondent exclusively.  However, the Respondent subsequently commenced proceedings in Lagos State, Nigeria seeking - “(a) A Declaration that the Claimant is entitled with the Defendant to equal share of the property lying, being and situate at No 12, Femi Akinfolarin Street, Off Association Avenue Road, Ikotun Lagos State and covered by Certificate of Occupancy dated 21st day of August, 1990 and registered as 55/55/1990Y, in the Land Registry at Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos State, containing 2 Wings of 8 Bedroom duplex each and its appurtenances thereof.

Ground 3: 3 Whether the learned Trial judge was right when he held that: “It is trite that he who alleges must prove therefore the burden is on the Defendant to led cogent evidence to that effect. As rightly submitted by counsel to the Plaintiff the failure of Defendant to tender a letter of revocation of the C of O Exhibit B or call an official of the revocation body to testify is fatal to this claim of Defendant.\" Ground 4. 4 Whether the learned Trial Court Judge was right when he held that Exhibit G tendered by the Defendant was a worthless sheet of paper Ground 5. 5 Whether the learned Trial Court Judge was right when he held that the issue of proper identification of land was not in issue Ground 6. 6 Whether the learned Trial Court Judge was right when he held as follows: “I quite agree with the submission of Yakubu that evidence of Defendant and DW II including Exhibit E sales agreement between the Defendant and Babale all goes to non - issue on ground that they are hearsay.\" Ground 8. 7 Whether the learned Trial Court Judge was right when he entered Judgment for the Plaintiff on proceedings conducted under extant rules. Ground 10.  In arguing issue one, learned Counsel to the Appellant submitted that the Plaintiff’s claim is for declaration of title to the land in dispute and that a party seeking declaration of title to land can prove same through any of the five ways of proving title to land. He referred to the case of Tundaolu v. Registered Trustees of O.I.M.C.S.C. Nig. And Overseas 2011 All FWLR Pt. 597 750 at 765 Paras.E-H.  That the RespondentPlaintiff chose to establish his title by the production of documents of title in respect of which he tendered Exhibits A and B which are grant of Right of Occupancy and Certificate of Occupancy respectively in consideration of which the trial Court relied on the said Exhibits and held that the Plaintiff had proved his claim on the preponderance of evidence and entered Judgment in his favour.  That the trial Court did not advert its mind to the binding decision of this Honourable Court in the case of Mr. Sunday Nwanko v. Mohammed Diyyab Jubril 2012 All FWLR Pt. 646 483 at 511 Paras. C-D Ratio 6 where this Court held: “The dangling of a statutory Certificate of Occupancy or a Local Government Certificate of Occupancy per se as a document of title over a disputed piece of land is not enough without proving the root of title of the person or authority through whom a person claims.\" He also referred to Rachael Yewande Adeshina v. Bag. Elec. Co. Ltd. & Anor. 2007 All FWLR Pt. 369 1279 at 1315 Paras. A - B where it was held that: “Where a Certificate of Occupancy is granted over land while there was a subsisting grant or deemed grant of right over the same land, the subsequent Certificate of Occupancy is invalid, null and void by reason of the existence of the subsisting grant.\"  It is submitted that in the instant case, the trial Court relied on Exhibits A and B in holding that the Plaintiff had proved title to the land, in spite of the evidence before the trial Court to the effect that the Ministry of Land and Survey which issued Exhibits A and B to the Plaintiff, issued null and void grant of Right of Occupancy and Certificate of Occupancy in view of the traditional title or deemed grant of Alhaji Saidu Saleh Babale from whom the Defendant acquired title to the land subject matter of this Appeal and by virtue of Exhibit G. That DWI and DWII on pages 140 - 147 of the Trial Court’s printed record gave vivid evidence on the traditional history of the DefendantAppellant’s title, traceable to one Aliyu’s father who founded the land in dispute and successive persons who acquired title to the land in dispute.  That he equally tendered Exhibit D which is the purchase receipt from Alh. Saidu Saleh Babale, Exhibit E which is an agreement between him and the said Alh. Saidu Saleh Babale; and that to crown it all, the DefendantAppellant tendered Exhibit G which is a document emanating from the same Ministry of Land and Survey Yola. That Exhibit G emphatically stated that the land which it unlawfully acquired had been returned to the traditional title holder and it was addressed to Alh. Saidu Sale the person from whom the Defendantcounter claimantAppellant purchased the land subject matter of this Appeal.  That Adamawa State Ministry of Land and Survey that issued Exhibits A and B, had nullified Exhibits A and B when it also issued Exhibit F.  That PW II, Mohammed Lawal Gidado who is a staff of the Ministry of Land and Survey Yola Adamawa State called by the Plaintiff and who gave his designation as Asst. Chief Estate Officer Lands testified under cross - examination on page 137 lines 19 - 25 as follows: “I know Aminu Abdulmajid. He is Secretary land Allocation Committee of our Ministry. I am aware when the said Aminu wrote to one of the traditional title holders returning his land to him that was acquired by Government. I can identify the letter from Aminu by his name and signature.\"  That Exhibit G is the letter referred to above which was tendered and admitted without objection. He referred to Alhaji Abatcha Mohammed Kolo v. Alhaji Mohammed Lawan 2011 ALL FWLR Pt. 597 725 at 737-738 Paras H-D Ratios 1 & 5.  That the PlaintiffRespondent did not file any reply to the DefendantAppellant’s further amended statement of defence and defence to the Defendant’s counter claim. That on the authority of Bankole v. Adeyeye 2014 ALL FWLR Pt. 571 1570 at 1583 Paras E-F Ratio 5, the Respondent has admitted the counter claim of the Appellant. He urged the Court to resolve issue one in favour of the Appellant. On issue two, it is submitted that what the lower Court granted as reliefs were not sought for because the PlaintiffRespondent did not identify the land in respect of which he sought declaration of title as he could not even identify the land he claims during the visit to the locus in quo. That the import is that he had no knowledge of the land not to talk of its demarcations. He referred to page 160 lines 21 - 27 where the Trial Court held as follows: “The Defendant in his submission agreed to the fact that Defendant during the visit to the locus inquo couldn’t identify the land in dispute, this brings the issue of failure to prove the identity of the land. This I don’t agree. I wholly agree with Yakubu that the issue of proper identification of the land is not an issue. Since the size and area of the land is clearly stated on the C of O Exhibit B, this is always ascertain issue.\"  That the reference to the Defendant by the Court in its pronouncement above was a slip. The Court was obviously referring to the Plaintiff as can be deduced therein. That the PlaintiffRespondent did not know the land he claimed to warrant the grant of the reliefs sought as consequential orders. He urged the Court to resolve issue two in favour of the Appellant.  On issue three, it is submitted that the trial Court failed to make recourse or give evidential value to Exhibits G and H admitted by the Court without any objection when it held on page 159 lines 24 - 27 and page 160 line 1 of the trial Court’s printed record as follows: “It is trite that he who alleges must prove therefore the burden is on the Defendant to lead cogent evidence to that effect. As rightly submitted by Counsel to Plaintiff the failure of Defendant to tender a letter of revocation of the C of O Exhibit B or call an official of the revocation body to testify is fatal to this claim.\"  According to counsel, the above holding of the Trial Court was, with due respect, legally erroneous because the allocation and issuance of Exhibits A and B were altogether null and void. This is in view of the non-revocation or proper acquisition of the land subject matter of this suit from the traditional title holder, who had a deemed grant which upon complains necessitated the return of the land by the Ministry to him. He referred to the evidence of PWI on page 130 lines 5 - 6 and cited the case of Rachael Yewande Adeshina v. Bag. Elec. Co. Ltd. Anor. Supra where it was held that:  “Where a Certificate of Occupancy is granted over land while there was a subsisting grant or deemed grant of right over the same land, the subsequent Certificate of Occupancy is invalid, null and void by reason of the existence of the subsisting grant.”  He urged us to resolve issue three in favour of the Appellant.  On issue four, Counsel adopted his submissions under issue three and added that Exhibit G was tendered without objection and urged us to hold that the trial Court was, with due respect in error to hold that Exhibit G was a worthless sheet of paper. That the facts averred in the Defendant’s further amended statement of defence making reference to Exhibit G were not denied. He urged the Court to resolve issue four in favour of the Appellant.  On issue five, Counsel submitted that this Court and the Apex Court, have held in a plethora of cases that for a party to succeed in an action for declaration of title, he must prove the identity of the land in issue. He referred to the case of Chief Rowland Tukuru & Ors. v. Chief Nathans Sabi 2013 SCNJ 212 at 232 Ratios 141 & 15 where the Supreme Court held:- “In order to succeed in a claim for trespass and injunction, the identity of the land and its boundaries must be established. In order to succeed in an action for trespass, the Plaintiff must be in exclusive occupation of the land. The law is that the Plaintiff cannot be granted a declaration of title if he fails to prove the identity of the land with certainty and precision.\"  According to Counsel, even from the pleadings, it is evident that the identity of the land was in issue; and he referred to paragraphs 4, 5 6 and 7 of the Plaintiff’s further amended statement of claim on pages 34 and 35 of the trial Court’s printed record, and paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Defendant’s further amended statement of defence and counter claim on pages 78 - 79 of the trial Court’s printed record. Counsel referred to Page 160 of the Record and submitted that the PlaintiffRespondent could not identify the land he is claiming even at the locus. That the tendering of the Certificate of Occupancy by the Respondent without tendering the site plan cannot amount to proper identification of the land. He urged us to resolve the fifth issue in favour of the Appellant.  On issue six, it is submitted that the evidence of DW1 and DW2 referred to the land the subject matter of this suit, given on the traditional history of how they acquired the land. Counsel referred to the case of Okwaraononi & Ors. v. Mbadugha & Ors. 2014 ALL FWLR Pt. 728 914 at 936 and submitted that evidence given on traditional history of land is an exception to the hearsay rule. He urged the Court to hold that the lower Court was in error when it held that the evidence of DW1 and DW2 amounted to hearsay and resolve the sixth issue in favour of the Appellant.  As regards issue seven, it is submitted that although the suit was commenced per the Plaintiff's writ of summons dated 582010 as shown on page 3 of the trial Court's printed record which was under the then Adamawa State High Court Civil Procedure Rules, 1987, the present Adamawa State High Court Civil Procedure Rules, 2013 came into effect on the 1st day of July, 2013 and in consequence of paragraph 1 3 of the said 2013 Rules, the Adamawa State High Court Civil Procedure Rules, 1987 ceased to have effect. That Order 21a, b, c and 2, a, b, c and d of the Adamawa State High Court Civil Procedure Rules, 2013 specified what should accompany a Plaintiff’s originating processes which include: a. The list of witnesses. b. Written statement on oath of the witnesses. c. Copies of every document to be relied on among others. He referred to the case of Shell Petroleum Development Company Nigeria v. Chief Jonas Oruwari & Ors. 2014 All FWLR Pt. 733 1996 at 2007 Ratio 7 where this Court held that: “Court Rules as opposed to substantive law operates retrospectively. Any documents pending before the Court which were made under repealed Rules of Court, must be amended to conform with the new Rules.\"  That although the Plaintiff’s originating processes were filed in 2010 before the coming into effect of the new Rules herein mentioned, PW2 testified on the 1062014 Page 136 of the printed record without compliance with the provision of Section 21 a - c 2 a- c of the Adamawa State High Court Civil Procedure Rules 2013.  That the proceedings in this suit was conducted under the extant Rules of the trial Court. He urged us to strike out the Suit and allow the Appeal.  In his response, learned Counsel to the Respondents submitted three issues for determination. Thus: 1 Whether the Respondent had by preponderance of evidence established his claims as to be entitled to judgment and if not, whether the Appellant had proved his counter claim to be entitled to judgment Grounds 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9 2 Whether the trial Court judge had powers to make consequential orders while delivering judgment Ground 5 3 Whether the Appellant had by credible evidence proved his averments relating to the alleged revocation of the title of the Respondent as pleaded in paragraphs 13, 7 and 12 in compliance with the extant provisions of the Land Use Act. Ground 7  On issue one, Counsel submitted that the Respondent in his evidence testified that he applied and was allocated land by Adamawa State Government and was issued with a Certificate of Occupancy Exhibit B. While PW2 a staff of the Ministry of lands testified that the title of the Respondent as in Exhibit B was not revoked. That since the identity of the disputed land was ascertained by the attached survey plan in Exhibit B, a visit to the locus is unnecessary; relying on the case of Emiri v. Imieyeh 1999 4 SCNJ 1 at page 4, Counsel referred to pages 159 to 160 of the printed record and submitted that the Appellant did not prove the revocation of the title of the Respondent by the production of the letter of the revocation as provided for by Section 28 6 of the Land Use Act.  According to Counsel, Exhibit G is vague and ambiguous document that the Appellant argued revoked the title acquired by the Respondent in Exhibit B. He cited the case of Kandix HD v. Attorney General C.R.S. 2012 ALL FWLR Part 624 Page 163 at 167 Ratio 3. That there cannot be a valid revocation of right of occupancy without the holder being served with notice relying on Lateju v. Fabayo 2012 Part 651 ALL FWLR 1575 at 1577 Ratio 3. That none of the witnesses of the Appellant gave valid evidence relating to traditional history. He urged this Court to resolve issue one in favour of the Respondent.  On issue two, it is submitted that the consequential orders made by the trial judge were necessary because Exhibit B, the Certificate of Occupancy contains the beacons numbers that demarcated the Respondent’s land. That the evidence led shows that the beacons were removed by unknown persons. Counsel however conceded that the trial judge was wrong when he ordered for the demolition of the structures developed by the Appellant on the land. According to him, whatever is affixed to the land becomes part of it. He therefore urged this Court to quash that part of the consequential order for the demolition as it does not flow from the judgment. He referred to Strabag Const. Nig Ltd v. Ibitokem Supra.  On issue three, it is submitted that the Appellant did not tender any letter of revocation issued to the Respondent by the relevant authority as envisaged under Section 286 of the Land Use Act. He adopted his arguments on issue one and the case law authorities cited thereto. On the issue of conducting the trial by the lower Court under the 1987 High Court Civil Procedure Rules of Adamawa State, it is submitted that Order 3 Rules 2 and 3 of the Adamawa State High Court Civil Procedure Rules 2013 provides that non-compliance with the Rules shall be treated as a mere irregularity and does not render the proceedings null and void.  He urged us to dismiss the Appeal and affirm the judgment of the lower Court with substantial cost.  In the Appellant’s reply Brief, the Appellant only re-argued his Appeal.  RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL This Appeal will be determined on issues 1, 2 and 7 for determination formulated by the Appellant. This is because while issue one formulated by the Appellant covers issues 3, 4, 5 and 6, the issues formulated by the Respondent are similar to issues 1, 2 and 4 formulated by the Appellant.   On issue one, it was the case of the Appellant that the RespondentPlaintiff chose to establish his title to the disputed land by tendering the grant of Right of Occupancy and the Certificate of Occupancy Exhibits A and B respectively. That the lower Court did not advert its mind to the fact that there was an existing grant which is the traditional title to the disputed land of Alhaji Saidu Saleh Babale from whom the AppellantDefendant acquired title to the disputed land. That the Appellant tendered Exhibits D and E the purchase receipt and sales agreement. That Exhibit G issued by the Ministry of Land Yola shows that the land which was unlawfully acquired was returned to Saidu Saleh. On the side of the Respondent, it was argued that the Respondent’s case was anchored on a grant vide a Certificate of Occupancy Exhibit B issued by Adamawa State Government over the disputed land. That the Appellant was not able to prove that the Respondent’s title has been revoked. That Exhibit G relied upon by the Appellant as the letter of revocation does not comply with Section 286 of the Land Use Act for failure to specifically refer to the disputed land or any land at all.  It is trite that in land matters, whoever claims declaration of title to land must succeed on the strength of his case and not on the weakness of the defence. See Ogundepo v. Olumesan 2012 ALL FWLR Part 609 1136.   Among the ways for proof of title to land is by production of documentary evidence. Exhibits A and B are the documents of title tendered by the RespondentPlaintiff. Exhibit A is the letter of grant while Exhibit B is the Certificate of Occupancy tendered through PW 1 Pages 128 - 129 of the printed record. The evidence at Page 128 of the printed Record shows that the Appellant encroached upon the Respondent’s plot of land, and when he met the Appellant, the Appellant told him that his plot of land was revoked and as a result of the revocation, the Appellant bought the land from someone.  The evidence led as shown at Pages 140 - 147 of the printed record shows that the Appellant bought the disputed land from one Alhaji Saidu Babale at the cost of N100,000. Exhibit E is the Sales Agreement between the Appellant and Alhaji Babale while Exhibits F & G are the letter of grant and another document issued to the Appellant by Adamawa State Ministry of Lands. During cross examination, the Appellant admitted that there is no where in Exhibit B the C of O issued to the Respondent that it was revoked.  From the evidence on record, it is clear that while the Respondent’s claim to the land in dispute before the lower Court is based on production of title documents Exhibits A and B respectively, the Appellant’s case is based on sale of the disputed land to him by one Alhaji Babale Saidu based on an alleged revocation of the Respondent's Certificate of Occupancy Exhibit B by Adamawa State Government. Exhibit G is the alleged revocation letter. As rightly stated by the lower Court in its judgment at Page 160 of the printed record, the Appellant who alleges such revocation of Exhibit G must prove same.  For clarity purposes Exhibit G reads:- “ADAMAWA STATE GOVERNMENT OFFICE OF THE HONOURABLE COMMISSIONER MINISTRY OF LAND & SURVEY, YOLA, NIGERIA Tel: 075-624435 627195 Our Ref: GSMLSLAN1365122 Date: 250507 Alh. Saidu Sale, No. 54 Yelwa Street, Jimeta, Yola. Sir, RE: COMPLAINT OVER LANDS TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL I am directed to refer to your letter dated 5th June, 2001 in connection with the above mentioned subject matter and to inform you that the Honourable Commissioner has approved the carving out of an area of about 16 hectares acquired from you out of the 26 hectares. 2 By this letter you are therefore advised to apply formally in respect of the area carved out for you and complete Land Form 1, and pay all the necessary fees; and then proceed to obtain title of ownership. 3 Your cooperation is highly appreciated, please. Signed Aminu Abdulmajid For: Honourable Commissioner.”  As I stated earlier in this judgment, Exhibit G reproduced above is the letter the Appellant alleged revoked the C of O given to the Respondent by Adamawa State Government. It is important at this stage to note that Section 28 6 of the Land Use Act provides:- “The revocation of a right of occupancy shall be signified under the hand of a public officer duly authorized in that behalf by the Governor and notice thereof shall be given to the holder.”   Section 28 7 of the same Act provides that:- “The title of the holder of the right of occupancy shall be extinguished on receipt by him of a notice given under sub Section 6.\"  Exhibit G as reproduced above is vague and does not in anyway refer to Exhibit B talk less of revoking same. In other words, Exhibit G did not give any notice to the Respondent revoking his Certificate of Occupancy Exhibit B. In the case of Kandix HD v. Attorney General & Commissioner for Justice C.R.S. Supra this Court Held that:- \"The purpose of giving notice of revocation of a right of occupancy is to duly inform the holder thereof, the steps being taken to extinguish his right of occupancy. In the absence of a proper notice of revocation of right of occupancy, the purported revocation of that right of occupancy by the Governor or officer duly authorized by the Governor is ineffectual.\"  The lower Court was therefore on a sound footing when it held in its judgment at Pages 159 - 160 of the printed record that:- \"...As rightly submitted by Counsel to plaintiff, the failure of the defendant to tender a letter of revocation of the C of O Exhibit B or call an official of the revocation body to testify is fatal to this claim of the defendant. It has been held in plethora of cases that a C of O remains valid until is revoked through due process. Any irregular method adopted renders it null and void.\"  Issue one is therefore resolved in favour of the Respondent and against the Appellant.   On issue 2, it is important to note that the consequential orders made by the trial judge were necessary because Exhibit B the Certificate of Occupancy contains the beacons with the numbers that demarcated the Respondent’s land. The evidence led at Page 130 of the Printed Record shows that the beacons were removed by unknown persons. Issue 2 is therefore resolved in favour of the Respondent and against the Appellant.   As to issue 7, that the lower Court conducted the trial under the 1987 Adamawa State High Court Civil Procedure Rules, while the 2013 Rules came into effect before the trial was concluded, it is important to note that Order 3 Rules 2 and 3 of the 2013 Rules provides that non-compliance with the Rules shall be treated as a mere irregularity and does not render the proceedings null and void. Issue 7 is therefore resolved in favour of the Respondent and against the Appellant.   Having resolved the issues against the Appellant and in favour of the Respondent, this Appeal is unmeritorious and is accordingly dismissed. The judgment of the lower Court delivered on 16th October, 2016 is hereby affirmed. Parties to bear their respective costs.   CHIDI NWAOMA UWA, J.C.A.:  I read a draft copy of the judgment delivered by my learned brother, ABDULLAHI MAHMUD BAYERO, JCA.   My learned brother had comprehensively resolved the issues that arose in this appeal, I align myself with the resolution and agree with the decision that the appeal is unmeritorious. I also dismiss it for the same reasons given in the leading judgment.   JAMES SHEHU ABIRIYI, J.C.A.:  I agree.-end!" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  HARUNA SIMON TSAMMANI, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  This appeal is against the judgment of the Ogun State High Court sitting in Abeokuta delivered on the 18th day of January, 2017 by A. A. Akinyemi, J in Charge No: AB5R2014.  The Appellant was arraigned on a two counts charge of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and armed robbery which are offences contrary to and punishable under Sections 6b and 12a of the Robbery and Firearms Special Provisions Act, Cap. R.11, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004. The Appellant was said to have, in company of two others now at large, robbed one Fashola Moses of his Bajaj Motorcycle, one Nokia Mobile phone and the sum of six thousand naira N6,000.00 on or about the 16122010 along Olujobi Village via Itori, Ogun State.  The case of the prosecution on record is that, at about 7.00p.m on the 16122010, the complainant Fashola Moses who testified as the PW1 was on his way to Ijoko in Yewa North Local Government Area on his Bajaj Motorcycle when the Appellant and two others stopped him and requested him to convey them to Ago-Olowo. That on their way, the engine then switched-off; and not knowing that it was deliberately switched-off by one of the passengers, the complainant stopped to check. That immediately one of the passengers struck him with a broken bottle on the forehead causing the complainant to fall down. The Appellant and his co-assailants took-off with the motorcycle leaving the complainant behind. That shortly after that, another motorcyclist came by and offered to assist the complainant pursue the robbers.  The prosecution also stated that the assailants were however involved in an accident in their bid to escape. That on arrival at the scene of the accident, the complainant explained to the villagers who had rushed to the scene of the accident, what transpired between him and those involved in the accident. That the villagers and the local Vigilante group then combed the surrounding bush where the Appellant and his co-assailants had run into, leading to the arrest of the Appellant while the others escaped.  The Appellant who had made an extra-judicial statement to the police confessing to the crime, retracted same at the trial. At the trial he Appellant, told the Court that, he had a body rash and had gone to the stream to bath and thereafter proceeded to Babalumo Village to buy fulcin to use for the body rash. That on his way, he saw some six 6 boys who were saying ”it is this kind of cloth”. That the boys then took him to the OPC office where he was beaten and later handed over to the police. That the police then called someone who came and accused him of being one of the persons who robbed him of his motorcycle. He therefore denied that he was one of the persons that robbed the PW1 on the 16122010.  At the trial, the prosecution called four witnesses and tendered four 4 exhibits marked as Exhibits “1A”, “1B”, “2” and “3” respectively. The Appellant testified in his own defence but called no witness. Learned counsel addressed the Court and in a considered judgment delivered on the 18th day of January, 2017 the learned trial Judge convicted the Appellant on both counts of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and for armed robbery and sentenced him to death. Being aggrieved by the decision, the Appellant has filed this appeal.  The Original Notice of Appeal which consisted of only the omnibus ground of appeal, was filed on the 1722017. However, by leave of this Court granted on the 26112018, the Appellant filed an Amended Notice of Appeal on the 29112018 consisting of three 3 Grounds of Appeal. The parties then filed and exchanged Briefs of Arguments. The Appellant’s Brief of Arguments which was filed on the 15119 raised therein, two issues for determination as follows: 1. Whether the allegations of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and armed robbery brought against the Appellant were proved by the prosecution so as to justify the conviction of the Appellant by the trial Court? 2. Whether the Appellant got fair trial before the trial Court?  The Respondent’s Brief of Arguments settled by Mrs. Olajumoke S. Ogunbode Principal State Counsel, Ogun State Ministry of Justice was filed on the 08419 but deemed filed on the 20519. Two issues were also raised by the Respondents for determination as follows: 1. Whether from the totality of evidence at the trial, the prosecution has proved the offence of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and armed robbery against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt. 2. Whether the Appellant was given fair hearing during the trial at the lower Court.  Having carefully considered the issues raised by both sides in this appeal, I am of the view that the following three 3 issues are germane for the determination of this appeal: 1. Whether from the proceedings on record, the Appellant had a fair trial in the trial Court? 2. Whether from the totality of the evidence adduced at the trial, the trial Court was right in convicting the Appellant for conspiracy to commit armed robbery? 3. Whether from the available oral and documentary evidence on the record, the trial Court was right in convicting the Appellant for having committed armed robbery?  In the determination of this appeal, I shall start with issue one 1, which raises the issue of fair hearing.  On issue one 1 therefore, learned counsel for the Appellant contended that the Appellant in the trial Court was represented by counsel who are staff of the Ogun State Ministry of Justice. That the office of the Public Defender is a Department under the leadership of the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice of Ogun State. That by Section 2111 and 2 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended, the Attorney-General as well as Officers of his department can only prosecute criminal cases but cannot defend an accused person in a criminal matter. That the Records show that a letter was written to the office of the Public Defender requesting for legal representation for the AccusedAppellant, but there is nothing on record to show that the Appellant was consulted before the request was made on his behalf. It was then submitted that, by being represented by counsel from the same office of the Attorney-General of Ogun State who are prosecuting him, the Appellant was exposed to the risk of a breach of his confidence andor compromise of his legal interest in the proceedings in the lower Court.  Learned Counsel for the Appellant went on to submit that, in law a person accused of a capital offence has the right to be defended by a legal practitioner of his own choice; or by counsel assigned to him by the Court if he is unable to afford the services of a counsel. The cases of Josiah v. State 1985 1 NWLR pt.1 125 and Adigwe v. F.R.N. 2015 8 NWLR pt.1490 105 at 135 were cited in support and to further submit that, in the instant case, the Appellant did not request to be represented by counsel from the office of the Ogun State Ministry of Justice. Furthermore, that it is clear from page 60 of the Record of Appeal, that the trial Court did not call upon the Appellant’s Counsel to address it on allocutus; and that the failure of the Court do so, rendered the entire proceedings null and void and of no effect. The case of Audu v. State 2016 1 NWLR pt.1494 557 at 565 was cited in support; and to urge us to resolve this issue in favour of the Appellant.  On this issue, learned counsel for the Respondent contended that, the principle of fair hearing is fundamental to the administration of justice. That, the principle requires that the Court conduct the trial of a case with fairness and impartially, and without bias to any of the parties. The cases of Peter Pam & Anor v. Mohammed & Anor 2008 5 S.C. pt.1 83 and Orugbo v. Una 2002 13 SCM 153 were cited in support. That the essence of fair hearing is to give the parties equal opportunity to be heard or present their cases.  The case of Okeke v. State 2003 15 NWLR pt.842 25 was then cited to submit that, in the instant case, there is no proof of any conflict of interest on the part of the defence counsel nor bias on their part. That in the instant case, the record show that, on the 061114 when the plea of the Appellant was taken, one O. Omoniyi; Esq. of counsel whose chamber is in Lagos appeared for the Appellant. That, one S. O. Ogunyemi; Esq. from the Chamber of O. O. Omoniyi represented the Appellant all through the trial. In other words, that the Appellant was represented by a private legal practitioner throughout the trial. That in any case, throughout the trial, the Appellant never made the issue of choice of counsel an issue at the trial.  Learned Counsel for the Respondent went on to submit that, assuming which he does not concede, that the office of the Citizen Rights Department represented the Appellant during the trial, it did not lead to a breach of the Appellant’s right to fair hearing. That in the case of The State v. Ibiloye Mathew 2018 LPELR - the Supreme Court held that, by Section 2111b and c of the 1999 Constitution, the powers of the Attorney-General is not just prosecutorial but also defensive, depending on the circumstances of each case. Furthermore, that the right of an accused is not compromised where a lawyer from a department of the Ministry of Justice takes up his defence. We were accordingly urged to resolve this issue against the Appellant.  Now, Section 366 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended stipulates that: “366. Every person who is charged with a criminal offence shall be entitled to - a....... b …….. c defend himself in person or by legal practitioner of his own choice;”  By the above provision therefore, the right of an accused person to defend himself is therefore an inviolable constitutional right in favour of an accused person. Such right is for the accused person to exercise either in person, or through a legal practitioner of his own choice. To that end, where an accused person appears before a trial Court unrepresented by counsel, the trial Court has a duty to inquire from him, whether he desires to defend himself in person or through a legal practitioner. Where he intends to defend himself in person, the Court shall proceed but where the charge is one that carries the sentence of death, and the accused has no capacity to secure the services of a legal practitioner, the Court has a duty under Section 352 of the Criminal Procedure Law of Ogun State to assign one.  I have perused the record of appeal. At page 27 of the record of appeal, it is recorded that when the AccusedAppellant was presented before the Court, the Appellant was not represented by counsel; and he Appellant requested the Court to assign one for his defence. The trial Court then directed the Registrar of the Court to write to the Citizen Rights Department to provide legal representation to the AccusedAppellant. On the 06112014, when the plea of the Appellant was taken, one O. Omoniyi; Esq. of counsel appeared for the accused. The said O. Omoniyi; Esq. with S.O. Oluyemi; Esq. appeared for the accused when PW1 and PW2 testified; and were duly cross-examined by counsel. Similarly, when PW3 and PW4 testified, the Appellant was duly represented by one S.O. Ogunyemi; Esq. of counsel who duly cross-examined the two witnesses and also raised necessary objection when the extra-judicial statements of the Appellant were tendered. Though, there is no indication whether counsel were from the Citizen Rights Department of the Ogun State Ministry of Justice, there is no indication that the Appellant protested the appearance of counsel for him. Indeed, it has been held in the case of Okon v. State 1995 1 NWLR pt.372 382 that, Section 366c which guarantees to an accused person the right to defend himself in person, or brief counsel of his own choice is intended to ensure, in the interest of justice, that an accused person is not denied the right to defend himself either personally, or through counsel of his own choice. Where an accused person has surrendered his right of choice of counsel to the Court, he cannot be heard to complain, where the Court does his bidding by assigning counsel. Thus in Okon v. State supra, the Supreme Court, per Iguh, J.S.C. said: “Where, the offence charged involves capital punishment on conviction and the accused person is not defended by a legal practitioner, the Court under Section 352 of the Criminal Procedure Act is enjoined and indeed bound to assign a legal practitioner for his defence. The assignment of counsel by the Court to an accused person is unable, or, has abandoned his right to brief a legal practitioner of his own choice to conduct his defence. The reason is because it is mandatory that an accused person shall be defended by a legal practitioner throughout his trial for an offence which involves capital punishment. Consequently, where in such a trial, an accused person fails to brief counsel, the Court shall assign one for his defence as he cannot be kept in custody indefinitely without trial because he does not have a legal practitioner of his own choice to conduct his defence. I think I should add that this duty imposed on the Court to assign counsel to defend an accused person who is unable to brief a legal practitioner for his defence in a capital offence does not, in my view, call for or require the consent of or any consultations with such an accused person before the same may be discharged.”  It should also be noted that, it is not the law that once a Court assigns counsel to an accused person, such an accused person will remain bound by it throughout the trial. Such an accused person is at liberty to reject, disown, protest, or even change such counsel if he is not satisfied with the performance of the counsel assigned to him by the Court. See Section 73 of the Legal Aid Act, Cap.205, Laws of the Federation and the case of Nwambe v. State 1995 3 NWLR pt.384 385. See also Nemi & Ors v. State 1994 LPELR - 24854 SC. In the instant case, the Appellant did not complain about the conduct of counsel assigned to defend him throughout the trial. On appeal before us, aside from making the assertion of likelihood of bias, or conflict of interest by counsel, the Appellant has not laid before this Court, facts upon which the Court can make such assumption or conclusion. Indeed, the record of appeal show that, counsel dutifully conducted the defence of the Appellant by cross-examining the witnesses called by the prosecution, and even raised objection to the admissibility of the extra-judicial statement of the Appellant when same were tendered. I am therefore of the view that, this issue raised by the Appellant is an afterthought. It is accordingly resolved against the Appellant.  Now, on issue one formulated by me, which deal with the conviction for armed robbery, learned counsel for the Appellant cited the cases of David Obue v. The State1976 All NLR 139 and Ogidi & Ors v. The State 2005 1 NCC 163 at 177 to submit that, in order to secure a conviction in any criminal trial, the prosecution must prove the charge against the accused person beyond reasonable doubt. That arriving at a decision, the trial Court must carefully consider the totality of the evidence presented before it in order to arrive at a decision as to whether or not the prosecution has been able to establish a case against the accused person beyond reasonable doubt. That, the prosecution’s case must be devoid of such contradictions that will cast doubt on its case, as once there are significant contributions in the prosecution’s case, the Court is enjoined to ascribe the benefit of it in favour of the accused person. The case of Olayinka v. State 2007 9 NWLR pt.1040 561 at 584 was cited in support.  Learned Counsel for the Appellant went on to submit that, the case of the prosecution was fraught with so much inconsistencies and contradictions on material facts that left the prosecution’s case short of the standard required by law. That, PW4 failed to establish that the broken bottle he recovered at the scene of crime was the same one used by the Appellant to commit the robbery. That the broken bottles were not even tendered as exhibits nor did the PW4 give evidence that the Appellant’s finger prints were analyzed to be on the broken bottle. That this fact is important because the Appellant denied visiting the place with any other person including the PW4. It was therefore contended that, the learned trial Judge was therefore wrong to convict the Appellant based on the testimony of PW4 who could not prove that the Appellant attacked PW1 with broken bottles. The cases of Egwu v. The State 2013 All FWLR pt.682 1812; Johnson v. The State 2013 3 NWLR pt.134078; Okeke v. The State 1995 4 NWLR pt.392 676 and Okpulor v. The State 1990 2 NWLR pt.164 541 were cited in support; and to further submit that the circumstances of the case require that the alleged broken bottles be tendered.  It was also argued by learned counsel for the Appellant that, PW1 did not say that the broken bottle recovered is the same as that with which he was stabbed nor is there any medical report to establish the fact that the injuryscar on PW1’s head was the result of a stab he received by the use of the broken bottle. Learned Counsel then submitted that, any piece of evidence which has been discredited cannot be relied upon by the trial Court in the determination of the guilt of an accused person. The case of Lateef v. The State 2013 17 NWLR pt.1383 281 was then cited to submit that, the evidence of the prosecution with regards to the broken bottles is incomplete.  Learned Counsel for the Appellant went on to submit that, the Appellant maintained that the contents of Exhibits “1A”, “1B” and “3” were dictated to him by PW3 and PW4 and therefore not voluntarily made by him. In other words, the Appellant denied making those statements. That, nonetheless, the learned trial Judge went on to convict the Appellant based on Exhibits “P3” and “P7” and the evidence of PW1 who never identified the Appellant. It was then submitted that, the trial Court could only convict the accused person based on his confessional statement if such statement was proved to be free, voluntary, direct and positively proved. The cases of Adisa v. The State 2013 14 NWLR pt.1375 567 and Obosi v. The State 1965 NMLR 119 were cited in support. That Exhibits “1A”, “1B” and “3” were not voluntarily made and therefore, the trial Court erred by relying on them to convict. We were accordingly urged to hold that the prosecution failed to prove their case against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt.  In response, learned counsel for the Respondent contended that in law, the commission of a crime may be proved by any one or all of the following ways: a by the account of eye witnesses who saw the commission of the offence. b by circumstantial evidence which unequivocally point at the guilt of the accused person. c through the voluntary confessional statement of the accused person.  That, the evidence led must establish the following ingredients of the offence of armed robbery beyond reasonable doubt i that there was a robbery. ii that the accused person was the robber or one of the robbers. iii that the robber was armed at the time of committing the robbery.  Learned Counsel for the Respondent then submitted that, the fact that there was an armed robbery was not in dispute at the trial. That, the testimony of PW1 who was the victim established beyond reasonable doubt that there was a robbery on the 16122010. As for the second 2nd ingredient, learned counsel contended that, there is ample evidence that the Appellant was armed with a broken bottle in the course of committing the robbery. To that extent, learned counsel commended the testimony of PW1 who was the victim of the robbery. Furthermore, that PW4 testified that broken bottles were recovered at the scene of the robbery. That, the Appellant admitted in his statement to the police Exhibits “1A”, “‘1B”‘ and “‘3”‘ that he was in possession of a broken bottle. The case of Osung v. The State 2011 11 SCM 176 at 197 was cited in support, and to also submit that, the prosecution satisfied the burden of proof that the Appellant was armed at the time of the robbery. The cases of Olayinka v. State 2007 9 NWLR pt.1040 561 and Hamza v. The State 2016 LPELR - 41557 CA were then cited to further submit that, the non-production of the weapon used by the Appellant is not a sine qua non to a conviction in a charge of armed robbery.  On the third ingredient, learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that, PW1 who doubled as a victim and eye witness of the offence, recognized the Appellant upon his arrest. The case of Nkebisi & Anor v. The State 2010 3 SCM 170 at 174 was then cited to submit that, the evidence of a single witness which is believed, given the circumstances of a case will not in law, require corroboration. That in the instant case, the testimony of PW1 is the direct evidence of a person who witnessed the crime and was able to identify his assailant. That in any case, where there is good and cogent evidence linking the accused to the crime charged, a formal identification parade is not necessary. The case of Adebayo v. The State 2014 8 SCM 34 was cited in support and to further submit that in the instant case, there was no dispute as to the identity of the Appellant as one of the persons that robbed PW1 on the 16122010. That the Appellant was arrested on the date of the robbery and made a statement to the police giving the graphic details of his involvement in the commission of the crime.  Learned Counsel for the Appellant also referred to Sections 28 and 29 of the Evidence Act, 2011 which define what confession is, and its effect, and proceeded to submit that, a trial Court can rely solely on the confessional statement of an accused person to convict him; provided such a statement is direct, positive and duly proved. The case of Akpa v. State 2008 8 SCM 68 at 70 was cited in support. That in the instant case, objection was raised as to the voluntariness of Exhibits “‘1A”‘, “‘1B”‘ and “‘3”‘ which led to a trial within trial before those statements were admitted. The cases of Ogudo v. The State 2011 11 - 12 SCM 209 at 212; Lasisi v. The State 2013 6 SCM 216 were cited to submit that the trial within trial was conducted even though the complaint of the Appellant was that he did not make those statements but that he was forced to sign an already prepared speech. It was then submitted that, the learned trial Judge having found that those statements were voluntarily made, was right to have considered them in convicting the Appellant.  Now, by Section 365 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended, every person who is charged with the commission of a criminal offence, shall be presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty. By that presumption of innocence therefore, the prosecution has the onerous duty of adducing credible evidence which will prove every ingredient of the offence charged beyond reasonable doubt. It therefore means that where any of the ingredients of the offence charged is not proved, or the evidence led in proof thereof is discredited by way of cross-examination, the charge has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Similarly, where the evidence adduced is contradictory on material elements of the offence, it would mean that a doubt has been created in the mind of the Court; and it would therefore be concluded that the charge has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. See Sections 131, 132 and 135 of the Evidence Act, 2011.   See also State v. Isiaka 2013 11 NWLR pt.1430 374 and State v. Azeez & Ors 2008 14 NWLR pt.1108 439. Thus in the case of Rasaki v. The State 2011 10 NWLR pt.1273 251, I said: “in an accusatorial system of administration of justice as practiced in this country, the general burden of proof lies always on the person who alleges. In criminal trials, the general or legal burden of proof lies on the prosecution and does not shift, to prove the guilt of the accused person. This legal burden is supported by Section 365 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which guarantees to all persons accused or charged with a criminal offence, the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. This burden, the prosecution must discharge beyond reasonable doubt by proving every ingredient of the offence charged by credible evidence which also rebuts any defense raised by the defense. Where at the close of evidence an essential element of the offence charged has not been proved, a doubt would have been created as to the guilt of the accused, and he shall be entitled to a discharge and acquittal.”  In the instant case, the Appellant was charged for having committed the principal offence of armed robbery. The hackneyed elements to be proved in a charge of armed robbery are: a. that there was a robbery or series of robberies; b. that the robbery or each of the robberies was an armed robbery; c. that the accused person was the robber or one of those who took part in the armed robbery.  It is also trite law that the commission of an offence, including armed robbery may be proved through any one or a combination of the following ways: a. by the direct evidence of a person or persons who saw the commission of the offence; b. by circumstantial evidence which lead to no other conclusion than that the accused person committed the offence. c. by the confessional statements of the accused person which is direct, positive, unequivocal and duly proved. See Michael Adeyemo v. The State 2015 LPELR - 24688 SC; Gabriel Ogogovie v. The State 2016 LPELR - 40501 SC; Joseph Bille v. The State 2016 LPELR - 40832 SC and Onuoha & Ors v. State 1989 3 NWLR pt.101 23.  In this appeal, the Appellant complains first of all, that the evidence led by the prosecution in the trial Court is full of contradictions on material facts. Specifically that the prosecution failed to establish that the broken bottle the PW4 said he recovered from the scene of crime are the same ones used in the commission of the robbery on PW1. It should be noted that, it is not every contradiction or inconsistency in the evidence adduced by the prosecution that will have the effect of discrediting the totality of the prosecution’s case. For a contradiction to affect the credibility of the prosecution’s case, it must be on material facts that touch on the root or essential elements of the offence charged. Therefore, minor or minute contradictions will be treated under the deminimis rule. See Osung v. The State 2012 18 NWLR pt.1332 256 at 278 paragraphs F - H; Bassey v. State 2012 12 NWLR pt.1314 209; Edet Okon Iko v. The State 2001 LPELR - 1480 SC and Corporal Isah Ahmed v. The Nigerian Army 2016 LPELR - 40826 SC. Thus, in Musa v. State 2009 15 NWLR pt.1165 467, the Supreme Court, per Fabiyi, J.S.C. said: “It is necessary at this juncture to point out that contradiction in the evidence of the prosecution that will be fatal must be substantive. It is not every miniature contradiction that can vitiate the case of the prosecution. Minor contradiction which did not affect the credibility of witnesses will be of no avail to the Appellant. Contradiction, to be worthy of note, must relate to the substance and indeed the vital ingredients of the offence charged. Trivial contradiction should not vitiate a trial”  It is clear therefore, that for a contradiction to avail an accused person, it must be one that is capable of creating doubt in the mind of the Court on a material issue at the trial. In the instant case, the complaint of the Appellant before us does not relate to any contradiction. At best, the complaint relate to evidence of the identity of the weapon used by the assailants on the PW1. Incidentally, no issue was raised at the trial on the identity of the weapon used in the commission of the robbery. This is more so, as the said broken bottles allegedly recovered by the PW4 at the scene of crime was not tendered in evidence. This issue is therefore a non-sequitur; but same leads us to the second complaint of the Appellant.  The Appellant had therefore complained that the prosecution failed to tender the broken bottles used in attacking the PW1. That, failure to so tender is fatal to the prosecution’s case. It is not the law that the prosecution must tender the weapon used in the commission of the robbery. In other words, it has never been the law that the weapon of robbery be tendered in evidence, and therefore, the prosecution need not tender the weapon of the offence of armed robbery. Failure of the prosecution to tender the offensive weapon without more, cannot result in the acquittal of the accused person. Once there is credible evidence that an offensive weapon was used, it will suffice, so long as all the essential elements that constitute the offence are proved by credible evidence beyond reasonable doubt. See Kayode Ayodeji v. The State 2017 LPELR - 42374 CA; Olayinka v. The State 2007 7 NWLR pt.1040 561 and Babarinde & Ors v. The State 2014 3 NWLR pt.1395 568. This is particularly so where there is cogent eye witness evidence of the commission of the offence. As My Lord, Kekere-Ekun, J.S.C. in the case of Babarinde v. The State supra said: “In order to secure a conviction for armed robbery, the prosecution must prove that the accused person was armed with an offensive weapon. The weapon may be a gun or any other object likely to induce fear of bodily harm in the victim such as a cutlass or machete. Where a gun or other offensive weapon is used in the commission of an offence, it is not essential to tender the weapon to secure a conviction, provided there is cogent eye witness evidence or in the absence of eye witness evidence, there is enough unequivocal circumstantial evidence that points to the guilt of the accused.”  My Lord, I.T. Muhammad, J.S.C. as he then was in the case of The People of Lagos State v. Mohammed Umaru 2014 7 NWLR pt.1407 584 put light to it in these words: “Although non-tendering of a weapon or weapons alleged to have been used on a victim of an armed robbery or any crime, for that matter, may not be fatal to prosecution’s case where the defendant confesses to the commission of the crime, the production of the items recovered from the scene of crime, including the alleged dagger, along with the statements made by PW1, and more importantly, the confessional statement said to have been made by the respondent, would have gone a long way to lay same weight to the evidence led by the prosecution”  In the instant case, the evidence on record discloses that, the persons who attacked the PW1 hit him on the head with a bottle causing him to bleed. That they took away his motorcycle and rode away; and that in their bid to escape, fell with the motorcycle thereby attracting the attention of other persons around. They robbers then escaped into a nearby bush before the PW1 who had gotten help from a fellow motorcyclist could arrive the scene of the accident. With the help of PW2, a local vigilante leader, a search was organized and the Appellant was arrested some few hours after the incident in the nearby bush while the others escaped. The PW3 testified under cross-examination that, when the crime was reported at the Ewekoro Police Station, he saw that the complainant PW1 had injury on his head inflicted with a bottle by the Appellant and his gang. The PW1 also gave evidence that he was hit on the forehead with a bottle and his motorcycle taken away. The learned trial Judge made findings on the issue of the weapon of the offence and concluded at page 54 lines 18 - 28 of the record of appeal as follows: “The evidence of PW2, PW3 and PW4 which were all cogent and credible, clearly corroborated that of PW1 that those who robbed him hit him on the head with a bottle, which caused him to bleed. I hold therefore that the prosecution has proved that the robbery was carried out with the use of an offensive weapon. The argument of Learned Defence Counsel to the effect that the failure of the prosecution to tender the broken bottles, and to produce medical report of the injury sustained by the PW1 or his failure to show his scar to the Court is fatal to the prosecution’s case, cuts no ice with me. While it is always desirable to tender the weapon of crime, where there are other compelling evidence linking the Accused to the offence, production of the weapon is unnecessary. See Olayinka v The State  2007 9 NWLR pt.1040 561; Sunday v. The State 2013 LPELR - 20196”  The above finding of the learned trial Judge is supported by the evidence on record. The victim of the crime who testified as the PW1, stated that the Appellant and his gang hit him on the forehead with a bottle or broken bottle and he fell down. That he sustained injury on his head as a result, leading to bleeding. The PW2 stated that PW1 had injury on his head, and that he and his boys took the PW1 and treated him of the injury. Under cross-examination, PW2 stated that: “When I got to the scene, I saw the victim on the ground with blood.”  The evidence of injury on the victim’s head was corroborated by the testimony of PW3 who testified under cross-examination that, he noticed that the complainant PW1 had injury on his head; and when asked the source of the injury, PW1 informed him that it was the Appellant and his gang that inflicted the injury on him with a bottle. That was on the 18122010, just two days after the robbery incident. On that note, I am satisfied with the finding of the trial Court, that the robbery was an armed robbery.  I also find that there is ample evidence on record which linked the Appellant with the robbery incident. In other words, there was evidence from the prosecution witnesses, including the confessional statements of the Appellant which fixed him at the scene of crime. I therefore agree with the findings of the learned trial Judge at page 55 lines 8 - 18 of the record of appeal, when he held as follows: “The final requirement in the charge of Armed Robbery is to link the Accused with active participation. PW1, the victim, testified that the Accused was among those who robbed him. There is ample evidence that the incident occurred at about 7:00p.m, when it was not yet too dark for PW1 to see and recognize his assailants. They stopped him like normal innocent passengers. They were not masked. He negotiated the fare with them, which gave him an opportunity to see their faces. He even had the presence of mind to notice that the Accused was the tallest of the three. Soon after he was robbed, the Accused was caught, and without any hesitation, he identified him as one of the robbers.”  After considering the relevant evidence of the PW1 and PW2 on the issue of identification, the learned trial Judge concluded at page 57 lines 2 - 23 of the record of appeal as follows: “In the instant case, as can be seen from the evidence reproduced above, PW1, the victim, gave a clear and unequivocal evidence of identification of the Accused at the earliest opportunity ... There is strong and convincing evidence that the Accused was one of the three 3 persons who had an accident with the motorcycle stolen from PW1, and who ran into the bush after the accident. There is also convincing and cogent evidence that he was caught inside the bush that he ran into that evening. There is further evidence that the moment PW1 saw him, he promptly and unhesitatingly recognized and identified him as one of those who robbed him. I find the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW4 linking the Accused to the crime, cogent, credible and convincing. I believe them as witnesses of truth. I disbelieve the evidence of the Accused that he was coming from the farm or the stream, and going to buy a drug for body rash, when he was accosted and arrested by same six 6 boys. In my view, there was sufficient evidence linking him with the crime, making a formal identification parade unnecessary. From the totality of the evidence before the Court, even without considering the confessional statements, I find and hold that the Accused was one of the three 3 persons who robbed PW1 of his motorcycle and other valuables on the 16th of December, 2010 after hitting him on the head with a bottle.”  It would be seen therefore, that the trial Court did not reach its decision to convict on the confessional statement of the Appellant alone. Rather, the learned trial Judge was of the view that the confession of the Appellant went to corroborate the evidence led by the prosecution witnesses. It should be noted that the confessional statements of the Appellant were tendered and admitted in evidence after a trial-within-trial. There is no ground of appeal which specifically challenges the admission of those statements in evidence. The effect therefore, is that, the Appellant has no complaint against the admissibility of those statements. The best that can be ascribed to the complaint of the Appellant on those confessional statements, would be under ground one 1, which is the omnibus ground. The complaint would therefore be that the learned trial Judge did not evaluate, or properly evaluate the evidence of confessional statements before ascribing weight thereto.  It is trite law that the primary or initial duty of evaluating and apportioning probative value or weight to evidence adduced at the trial, is on the trial Court which saw, heard and observed the witnesses as they testified. Therefore, once the learned trial Judge has dutifully performed his role, this Court, being an Appellate Court will not interfere. This Court can only validly interfere with the findings of the trial Court where such findings are perverse, in the sense that they have occasioned injustice, or that the trial Court wrongly applied the law to the facts, or introduced extraneous facts into the issues under consideration. See Okechukwu Chukwu v. The State  2012 LPELR - 15360 CA; Akindipe v. State 2008 15 NWLR pt.1111 560 and Umaru Hassan v. Markus Gwani 2014 LPELR - 24594 CA. See also Dr. Soga Ogundalu v. Chief A.E.O. Macjob 2015 LPELR - 24458 SC. Thus, in evaluating the confessional statements of the Appellant made to the police, the learned trial Judge held at pages 57 line 24 - 58 line 5 as follows: “Notwithstanding, I shall still consider the confessional statements of the Accused person. Exhibit “3”, which was admitted after a trial-within-trial, was the 1st Statement made by the Accused the very next day after the commission of the crime, at Ewekoro Police Division. In it, he confessed to his participation in the crime and mentioned the two 2 other members of his gang to be Alaja and Ebony. He narrated how the robbery was executed and how he was subsequently arrested. His narration in the statement does not materially differ from the narration of PW1, the victim. It was graphic, direct, positive and straight forward. The Court held after the trial within trial that it was freely and voluntarily made. The other facts in evidence clearly support and corroborate the content of this statement. The Accused had the opportunity to commit the crime, being on the scene that night, and he could have made the statement, considering the way he was arrested, leaving him with no other choice. It is my considered view that this statement passes the test of truth and is reliable to be acted upon by the Court. I find and hold that the Accused made Exhibit “3” freely and voluntarily and that its contents are true.”  The learned trial Judge went on to make findings at page 58 lines 23 - 32 of the record of appeal as follows: “Again, I find that the contents of these statements are corroborated by other evidence in the case, outside of the statements especially evidence of PW1 and PW2 and hold that they are true as far as can be tested by all the surrounding facts and circumstances. I also find and hold that the Accused had the opportunity to commit the offence as he was fixed at the scene of the crime by the evidence of PW1. Also, the confession is very possible considering how he was arrested within a short distance and time from the commission of the crime. Furthermore, the confession is very consistent with the other facts as proved by other evidence before the Court.”  I endorse the above findings of the learned trial Judge. Indeed, the PW1, being the victim of the crime testified that he had to negotiate with his assailants for the fare they would pay. Which means that, the PW1 had sufficient time and opportunity to observe his assailants. The Appellant was arrested a short distance from the scene of crime and a few hours after the robbery incident. It should also be noted that the robbery incident took place at about 7.00p.m on the 16122010 and the Appellant was arrested a few hours later that night. The Appellant did not give account of his whereabouts at 7.00p.m on the 16122010. He only stated that: “On 16th December, 2010, I went to the farm to farm - had a body rash. I went to the stream to bath and I went to Babalumo Village to buy fucin to use for the body rash. As I was going I saw about 6 boys saying ‘it is this kind of cloth. They took me to OPC Zone.’”  As I stated earlier, the robbery took place at about 7.00p.m. It is inconceivable that the Appellant could have been going to the farm to farm at 7.00p.m. I do not therefore believe the testimony of the Appellant as it did not in any way state his whereabout at the time of the robbery incident. The only logical conclusion is that, the confession of the Appellant which was made immediately after his arrest is true, considering the entire circumstances of the case. In any case, the confessional statements of the Appellant were amply supported by other evidence on record. The learned trial Judge was therefore right when he held that: “.. with or without the confessional statements of the Accused person, the prosecution has satisfactorily proved beyond reasonable doubt, all the ingredients of Armed Robbery against the Accused Person.”  On that note, I am of the view that the learned trial Judge was right in convicting the Appellant for having committed the offence of armed robbery.  On the conviction for conspiracy, learned counsel for the Appellant did not proffer any argument on the issue of the conviction for conspiracy to commit armed robbery. It is the law that, issues for determination formulated in a Brief of Arguments and on which no arguments are proffered in the Brief of Arguments, are deemed abandoned. Such issue should be struck out. See Agbo v. State 2006 6 NWLR pt.977 545, Ali v. State 2012 7 NWLR pt.1299 209 and Institute of Health, Ahmadu Bello University Hospital Management Board v. Anyip 2011 12 NWLR pt.1260 1. Thus, in Buhari & Ors v. Obasanjo & Ors 2003 17 NWLR pt.850 510, the Supreme Court held as follows: “The law is settled that where counsel proffered no argument on any issue before the Court, such an issue is deemed as having been abandoned”. In the instant case, the Appellant having not proffered any arguments on his conviction for conspiracy, is deemed to have abandoned that issue. The implication of that is that the conviction of the Appellant for conspiracy to commit armed robbery has not been challenged.  On the whole therefore, it would be seen that this appeal has no merit. It has failed and is accordingly dismissed. Consequently, the judgment of Ogun State High Court sitting at Abeokuta in Charge No: AB5R2014 delivered on the 18th day of January, 2017 is hereby affirmed.   NONYEREM OKORONKWO, J.C.A.:  After an extensive review of this case of armed robbery on appeal before us, my learned brother quoting the trial judge at page 27 of the lead Judgment said: The only logical conclusion is that, the confession of the Appellant which was made immediately after his arrest is true, considering the entire circumstances of the case. In any case, the confessional statements of the Appellant were amply supported by other evidence on record. The learned trial judge was therefore right when he held that:  \" ....with or without the confessional statements of the Accused person, the prosecution has satisfactorily proved beyond reasonable doubt, all the ingredients of Armed Robbery against the Accused Person.”  I agree entirely with the conclusion arrived at. I will also dismiss the appeal as lacking in merit.   FOLASADE AYODEJI OJO, J.C.A.:  I have read in advance the judgment delivered by learned brother, Haruna Simon Tsammani J.C.A.. His Lordship has dealt exhaustively with the issues in this appeal and I agree completely with the reasoning and conclusions reached therein.  The law is trite that evidence of an eye witness is one of the best evidence available in criminal trials as it is direct and provides an on the spot narration of the commission of the crime. It is more reliable than an identification parade. Such evidence must however be examined in detail by the trial judge. The need for detail examination is hinged on the tendency of victims of violent crimes to quickly implicate anyone shown to them by the Police as the culprit. It is for this reason that Courts are enjoined to take into consideration certain factors in resolving eye-witness identification of a criminal. See State vs. Yahaya  2019 13 NWLR Pt. 1690 397; Ochiba vs. State 2011 17 NWLR Pt. 1277 633; Ndidi vs. State 2007 13 NWLR Pt. 1052 633. In Adekoya vs. State 2017 7 NWLR Pt. 1565 343, the Supreme Court, per Peter-Odili, J.S.C. held that: \"The Court of Appeal had this to say that in view of the circumstances of the case that there was no need for an identification parade as the evidence of PW1 and PW4 in particular was overwhelming and cogent enough to show that the appellant was one of armed robbers that robbed PW1 at her residence on 1122005. In the guide as reiterated in Ndidi v State 2007 5 SCNJ 274 at 286-287 the Supreme Court had stated that in proving identity of an accused the following must be taken into consideration: a. Circumstances in which the eye-witness saw the accused: b. The length of time the witness saw the accused; c. The light conditions: d. The opportunity of close observation: e. The previous contact between the parties.\"  In the instant appeal, PW1 was the victim of the crime. As stated in the lead Judgment, PW1 negotiated with the Appellant and his co-assailant on the transport fare to be paid by them. There was therefore sufficient time for him to note the physical features of the Appellant to wit: that the Appellant was taller than his co-assailants. Furthermore, it was not yet dark as the robbery took place at 7.00pm. PW1 therefore had the opportunity to closely observe the Appellant and the other assailants who stopped him like normal passengers. The trial Court took into consideration laid down guiding factors before ascribing probative value to the eye-witness account of P.W. 1. His conclusion cannot be faulted.  It is for the foregoing and the fuller reasons contained in the lead Judgment that I also find this appeal unmeritorious and it is accordingly dismissed by me. I equally affirm the Judgment of the trial Court.-end! " ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  EMMANUEL AKOMAYE AGIM, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  This appeal No. CAA1007C2019 was commenced on 7102019 when the appellant herein filed a notice of appeal against the judgment of the Federal High Court in criminal case No: FHCABJCR3622015 delivered on 3092019 by O.E. Abang J. The notice of appeal which contains 10 grounds of appeal, was with leave of Court amended on 9-12-2019. The amended notice of appeal also contains 10 grounds of appeal.  The appellant and 1st respondent filed their respective briefs as follows- appellant’s brief, 1st respondent’s brief and appellant’s reply brief.  Learned counsel for the 2nd respondent stated during the hearing of this appeal that the 2nd respondent did not file a brief.  The appellant’s brief raised the following issues for determination- 1. Whether contrary to the decision of the Hon. Abang J of the Federal High Court Abuja, the Administration of Criminal Justice Act permits the transfer, the abandonment or relinquishment of a part-heard criminal case by its presiding Judge for any reason whatsoever, be it at the instance, instigation or with the support of the prosecution or defence or even at the instance of the Court itself? Issue No1 Grounds 1, 2, 3 and 10 of the notice of appeal. 2. Whether the resort by the trial Court to cloistered examination of documents in the case file in this matter as justification for the transfer of the case file by the Judges involved therewith is correct or justified in law and if answered in the negative whether the case file should not be returned to the Hon. A.R. Mohammed J for him to conclude adjudication and determine the charge one way or the other. 3. Whether the decision of Abang J being appealed against is in accord with the letter and spirit of the administration of Criminal Justice Act which prevents nomadic or itinerant movement of cases from one Court to the other and the clear absence of any order of the Hon. A.R. Mohammed J lawfully recusing himself from charge No. FHCABJCR3622015 between Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Gabriel Suswam and Omadachi Okolobia, the hearing notice showing that the matter has been transferred by the Honourable Chief Judge of the Federal High Court and every step taken thereafter are not: i Unlawful ii Breach of the applicants right to fair hearing and equality of arms with the prosecution. iii Breach of Section 366 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. iv Breach of numerous provisions, particularly Sections 11 and 3967 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015. v Illegal, unconstitutional and therefore null and void? Issue No 3 Grounds 7, 8 and 9 of the Notice of Appeal.  The 1st respondent’s brief raised one issue for determination as follows-  “Whether the learned trial judge was not right in refusing to decline jurisdiction when this case was reassigned to his Lordship Hon. Abang, J. after Hon. A.R. Mohammed, J. had voluntarily withdrawn from the case the second time. See grounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Notice of Appeal”.  The 1st respondent had filed a notice of preliminary objection to the appeal which it reproduced and argued at pages 5 - 16 of its brief. The ground for the objection is that leave was not first obtained to file this interlocutory appeal on grounds of mixed law and facts and that therefore the appeal is incompetent. This objection became baseless and unnecessary when the appellant by a motion on notice filed on 16122019 applied for, and was granted, leave to appeal on the grounds of mixed law and facts in grounds 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the amended notice of appeal. The objection is therefore hereby struck out.  I will determine this appeal on the basis of the issues raised for determination in the appellant’s brief.  I think that they can be conveniently determined together. Therefore I would consider them together as the appellant has done.  I have carefully read and considered all the arguments in the respective briefs on these issues.  The appellant and 2nd respondent were arraigned on 10112015 in the trial Court presided over by Hon. Justice A.R. Mohammed. Their trial proceeded thereafter and PW1, PW2, PW3 and PW4 conclusively testified as witnesses for the prosecution. On 2252019, His Lordship A.R. Mohammed J. granted the appellant’s application for adjournment thusly-  “Application for adjournment by 1st Defendant’s counsel is granted. It is hoped that the 1st Defendant’s counsel will be ready for the continuation of the trial on the next adjourned date. This case is therefore adjourned to 9th and 10th of July, 2019 for continuation of trial.”  Proceedings in the criminal case in the trial Court however resumed before another Judge, Honourable Justice O.E. Abang on 2492019. On this date Learned Counsel for the prosecution informed the Court that they got hearing notice that the case was to be heard by O.E. Abang J, that since the case was coming up before His Lordship for the first time, and would as a result start de novo, he was applying that the defendants be arraigned afresh. Learned Counsel for the appellant objected to the said application for the arraignment of the defendants on the ground that they had filed an application on 2392019 challenging the resumption of proceedings in the case before O.E. Abang J and contending that the trial Court presided over by O.E. Abang J had no jurisdiction to continue the proceedings in the case.  The appellant’s said motion on notice filed on 2392019 applied for- “1. An Order of this Honourable Court declining jurisdiction in respect of CHARGE NO: FHCABJCR3622015 BETWEEN FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA v. GABRIEL TORWUA SUSWAM AND OMODACHI OKOLOBIA pending part-heard under the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 before the Honourable A.R. Mohammed J. of the Federal High Court Abuja Judicial Division. 2. An Order of this Honourable Court returning the case file in CHARGE NO: FHCABJCR3622015 BETWEEN FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA v. GABRIEL TORWUA SUSWAM AND OMODACHI OKOLOBIA to the Honourable the Acting Chief Judge of the Federal High Court of Nigeria Hon. Justice John Tsoho to return the afore-described file to Hon. Mohammed J where the matter is extensively part-heard. 3. And for such orders as this Honourable Court may deem fit to make in the circumstances of this case.”  The 2nd respondent filed a similar motion on notice on 25-9-2019 praying for- “1. An Order of this Honourable Court declining in respect of CHARGE NO: FHCABJCR3622015 BETWEEN FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA v. GABRIEL TORWUA SUSWAM AND OMODACHI OKOLOBIA pending part-heard under the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 before the Honourable A.R. Mohammed J., of the Federal High Court Abuja Judicial Division. 2. An Order of this Honourable Court returning the case file in CHARGE NO: FHCABJCR3622015 BETWEEN FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA v. GABRIEL TORWUA SUSWAM AND OMODACHI OKOLOBIA to the Honourable Acting Chief Judge of the Federal High Court of Nigeria, Hon. Justice John Tsoho to return the afore-described file to Hon. Mohammed J., where the matter is extensively part-heard. 3. And for such orders as this Honourable Court may deem fit to make in the circumstances of this case.”  The trial Court, after considering the affidavits in support of the applications, the counter affidavits in opposition of the applications and the written addresses of all sides, rendered a ruling on 3092019 dismissing the applications, ordered the trial of the case de novo and a fresh arraignment of the defendants the same day.  The defendants were accordingly so arraigned on 30-9-2019. Following their respective plea of not guilty to the counts of offences in the charge, the case was adjourned to 29th, 30th and 31st October, 2019 for trial.  During the hearing of this appeal, Learned Counsel for the 1st respondent informed this Court from the Bar that the trial of the defendants by the trial Court presided over by O.E. Abang J., is ongoing and that so far, three witnesses have testified for the prosecution. Learned SAN for the appellant agreed with the above factual statement of Learned Counsel for the 1st respondent. Upon this information, this Court asked the parties to address it on whether the fact that the trial de novo before O.E. Abang J. is on-going, has progressed to an advanced stage and three witnesses have already testified for the prosecution, has not rendered this appeal unnecessary and academic.  Learned SAN for the appellant has argued that the appeal is still relevant, valid and not rendered an academic exercise by the fact that three prosecution witnesses have already testified in the ongoing trial de novo because the appeal contends that since the case did not move from A.R. Mohammed J to O.E. Abang J. as required by the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, the trial Court presided over by O.E. Abang J had no jurisdiction to entertain the case and conduct proceedings therein, that the proceedings already conducted de novo including the testimonies of the three prosecution witnesses are a nullity and that the de novo trial would rob the appellant the advantage it has gained from the 1st respondent declaring its PW4 a hostile witness and cross examining him.  Learned Counsel for the 1st respondent simply argued that the appeal is rendered academic as there is no need for sending the case back to A.R. Mohammed J for retrial.  Even though this issue strikes at the competence of this appeal, and therefore should be dealt with first before delving into the merit of the appeal, I prefer to deal with it after I have considered and determined the merits of the issues raised for determination in this appeal because its determination preliminary would prejudge some parts of the merit of this appeal.  It is glaring from the record of this appeal that the parties had no notice of how and why the criminal case that had been adjourned by A. R. Mohammed J for continuation of trial became listed before O.E. Abang J. for hearing on 2492019 and rightly contended that they were not aware of any order by A. R. Mohammed J. recusing himself from the case or an order transferring the case from A. R. Mohammed J to O. E. Abang J. It was the ruling of the trial Court determining their objection to the hearing of the case by O.E. Abang J. that informed them how the case moved from A.R. Mohammed J. to O.E. Abang J. The part of the said ruling containing this information reads thusly- “The file, I perused its contents and realised that this matter was formerly before A.R. Mohammed J. of the Federal High Court bench Abuja division for adjudication. Before Mohammed J, 4 witnesses have been called, the 1st to 3rd witnesses have testified in chief and cross examined. The 4th witness is currently in the witness box testifying. In the Court’s file, I stumbled on a letter written by A.R. Mohammed J. addressed to the Honourable Chief Judge of this Court dated 572019, informing His Lordship of his withdrawal from the matter, that the matter be re-assigned to another Judge for adjudication.  Before I go further in this matter, I want to quickly state that a Court of Law has jurisdiction to look at the contents of the case file and make use of any document therein in order to do justice in the matter. This is so because none of the parties in this matter. Therefore, it is lawful for the Court to make reference to the letter which is document in the file case relevant to the proceedings in order to do justice in this matter. The letter by A.R. Mohammed J. addressed to Honourable Chief Judge of this Court forms part of the records of the Court. Though the letter was not placed before the Court in any of the affidavits filed by the parties but they have made reference to the issue arising from the letter in the course of their argument. A portion of the letter is hereby reproduced for ease of reference starting from the 2nd paragraph of page 2 of the letter. Mohammed J said- “Now another disturbing incident has occurred concerning the case. On 4th June 2019 the same Sahara Reporters have again published another report alleging that in June 2019, the 1st Defendant Gabriel Tarwua Suswam has bribed me with foreign currency equivalent of 500 million at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja to quash the charge against him when the case comes up on 9th and 10th of July 2019. What I find very disturbing is the continuous attack on my integrity by Sahara Reporters on this case. How can a Judge quash a case on a date when the trial is still ongoing. The prosecution is still calling evidence and has not close its case. This therefore makes it absurd to allege that a charge could be quashed at a stage when trial is still ongoing. Let me state categorically that there is no basis for me to continue presiding over this case. This is because if at the end of trial, the 1st Defendant is discharged or acquitted, the conclusion is that he has bribed me to do so. If on the other hand, the 1st Defendant is found guilty and convicted, the conclusion is that I did so to prove that I did not receive bribe from him. From whatever angle one looks at the situation it will be proper to recuse myself from handling this case. I therefore remit the case to your Lordship for re-assignment to another Judge in the overall interest of Justice. Based on this letter addressed to the Honourable Chief Judge, Mohammed J. recused himself from the matter. The Chief Judge then in the discharge of this administrative functions re-assigned the matter to this Court as presently constituted.”  Learned SAN has argued that the Hon. Abang J. erred in law when he suo motu raised and relied on the contents of a letter dated 5th July 2019, not forming part of the record of the trial Court or the evidence of parties having not been filed at the Registry of the FHC and submissions of counsel in the Motion before the Court in arriving at his decision that the Hon. A.R. Mohammed J. before whom the matter was part-heard having taken 4 of the Prosecution witnesses had a basis and was indeed justified to have voluntarily recused himself from the trial of the Defendants, that the letter in issue was not brought to the attention of any of the parties either by Mohammed J. or by Abang J. and same did not form part of the documents filed and relied upon by the Parties in evidence in Appellant’s Application before the lower Court, that consequently, Hon. Abang J. having found that none of the parties before the lower Court especially the Appellant had any knowledge or notice of the letter referred to above, was in error to have considered same in determining the application before the Court, that this kind or style of adjudication, i.e. embarking on a voyage of discovery outside what the parties have placed before the Court’s is wrong, that indeed, both Hon. Abang J. himself and Hon. Mohammed J. fell into the same error when they referred suo motu to the contents of an alien document and used it as justification for Mohammed J’s irregular and unconstitutional recusal from the case.  Learned Counsel for the 1st respondent did not respond to the above argument.  The argument of Learned SAN for the appellant that the letter dated 5th July, 2019 did not form part of the record of the trial Court in the case before it is incompetent and invalid because there is no ground of this appeal complaining against the specific holding of the trial Court that the letter is a document in the case file relevant to the proceedings. In the Court’s file, I stumbled on a letter written by A.R. Mohammed J. addressed to the Honourable Chief Judge of this Court dated 572019, informing His Lordship of his withdrawal from the matter, that the matter be re-assigned to another Judge for adjudication is document in the file case relevant to the proceedings in order to do justice in this matter. The letter by A.R. Mohammed J. addressed to Honourable Chief Judge of this Court forms part of the records of the Court. Though the letter was not placed before the Court in any of the affidavits filed by the parties but they have made reference to the issue arising from the letter in the course of their argument. By not appealing against this holding, the appellant accepted it as correct, conclusive and binding. See Iyoho V Effiong 2007 4 SC Pt.iii 90. Having accepted it as correct, conclusive and binding, he cannot competently and validly argue contrary to the holding. See Dabup V Kolo 1993 12 SCNJ 1.  Since the said letter of A.R. Mohammed J. is a document in the file of the case and is relevant to the issues arising for determination from the applications of the defendants objecting to the hearing of the case by O.E. Abang J, it was validly relied on by O.E Abang J to determine the issue of how the case file moved from A.R. Mohammed J to him. The argument of Learned SAN that the trial Court should not have relied on the said letter because it was not brought to the attention of the parties to the case and therefore none of the parties had knowledge or notice of it is not correct. A Court can rely on every record in the file of the case before it in determining the issues raised by the parties for its determination. The record of a case includes the recordings of the daily proceedings, the processes filed in the case, the endorsements and documents in the case file concerning the administrative actions of the Judge or the registry staff concerning the case. Some of these administrative actions may not be brought to the notice of the parties to the case. In our present case, one of such administrative actions of the Judge has created a situation where a criminal case whose hearing before him had progressed to an advanced stage is now being heard de novo by another Judge. In determining the issue of how and why the said case, adjourned for continuation of hearing by A.R Mohammed J, is now before O.E. Abang J, the record in the case file showing why and how the case came before him was correctly relied on by Abang J to determine the issue of how and why the case adjourned for continuation of hearing by A.R. Mohammed J moved to him. He could not have validly ignored and disregarded the letter in the case file that shed light on how the file moved to him from A.R. Mohammed J in determining the issue of how and why the file so moved, even though the letter did not form part of the affidavit evidence adduced by the parties before him. This is because it is part of the record of the case file.  The trial Court found as a fact that based on this letter addressed to the Honourable Chief Judge, Mohammed J. recused himself from the matter and that the Chief Judge then in the discharge of his administrative functions re-assigned the matter to O. E. Abang J. This finding is not challenged by any ground of this appeal. It is therefore accepted by the appellant as correct, conclusive and binding on how the case file moved from A.R. Mohammed to O.E. Abang J. See Iyoho V Effiong 2007 4 SC Pt.iii 90.  It is obvious from this unchallenged finding that O.E. Abang J did not unilaterally take over the case from A.R. Mohammed J. It was reassigned to him by the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court in exercise of his power under Section 193 and 4 of the Federal High Court Act which provides that - “3 The Chief Judge shall determine the distribution of the business before the Court amongst the Judges thereof and may assign any judicial function to any Judge or Judges or in respect of a particular cause or matter in a Judicial Division. 4 Subject to the directions of the Chief Judge, every Judge of the Court shall sit for the trial of civil and criminal causes or matters and for the disposal of other legal business the Chief Judge may think fit.”  Let me now consider the issue of whether it was right and lawful for A.R. Mohammed J who was hearing the criminal case and had adjourned it after the conclusion of PW4’s testimony for continuation of hearing, to have suo moto recused himself from continuing to hear the case and returned the case file to the Chief Judge for reassignment without notice to the parties to the case. Although the decision of A.R. Mohammed J recusing himself from continuing the trial of the case is not the specific subject of this appeal, it is relevant to the determination of this appeal because the ruling of O.E. Abang J of 3092019 appealed against here, essentially considered the lawfulness and propriety of the said recusal and the resulting reassignment of the case by the Chief Judge to O.E. Abang J as justifying his trial of the case. The reliance on the recusal by O.E. Abang J in his ruling of 3092019 constitutes the crux of the complaints in grounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 of his appeal.  I agree with the submission of the Learned SAN for the appellant that it was wrong and unlawful for A.R Mohammed J to have surreptitiously and suo motu recused himself from continuing the hearing of the criminal case after 4 witnesses had testified for the prosecution and returned it to the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court for reassignment to another Judge without notice of the parties to the case and without affording them the opportunity to address him on that issue before he recused himself.  A Judge of the Federal High Court can without an application from any of the parties to a case before him or her recuse himself or herself from the case by virtue of Section 221 of the Federal High Court Act Cap. F12 Vol.6 Laws of the Federation 2004 which provides that “A Judge of the Court may at any time or that any stage of the proceedings before final judgment, either with or without application from any of the parties thereto, transfer such cause or matter from before him to any other judge of the Court”. But this power cannot be exercised according to the whims of the Judge or in any manner. Since the trial of the case was ongoing and the matter had been adjourned from 22nd May 2019 to 9th and 10th July 2019 for continuation of trial, A.R. Mohammed J’s recusal or withdrawal from the case is a step or process in the case that sets aside his order adjourning the case for continuation of trial on 9th and 10th July 2019. Such a step or process by a Judge in the ongoing trial proceedings in a case before him must be done in open Court during the proceedings and not in the secrecy of his office without notice to the parties in the ongoing proceedings. This is so by virtue of Section 363 and 4 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which requires that- “3 The proceedings of a Court or the proceedings of any tribunal relating to the matters mentioned in Subsection 1 of this section including the announcement of decisions of the Court or tribunal shall be held in public. 4 Whenever any person is charged with a criminal offence, he shall unless the charge is withdrawn, be entitled to a fair hearing in public within a reasonable time by a Court or tribunal.”  By virtue of these provisions, every part of an ongoing proceedings before a Court must be in public and not in secrecy. See N.A.B Ltd v Barri Engineering Nig Ltd 1995 LPELR - 2007 SC in which the Supreme Court held that “Public confidence in the administration of justice can be weakened by secrecy. Even handed justice is best done when it is done in the public gaze.\" See also the decision of this Court in Okpokiri V Okpokiri.  As it is, the failure of A.R. Mohammed J to give the parties the opportunity to be heard on the need for his recusal or withdrawal from continuing the trial of the case before he recused himself therefrom and returned the case file to the Chief Judge for reassignment to another Judge for trial de novo, violates the fundamental rights of the parties given to them by S.361 of the 1999 Constitution. They were entitled to be heard before being deprived their right to the progression of the trial proceedings that had reached an advanced stage and being imposed with the obligation to start the trial afresh and suffer more financial and other costs than they would have suffered if the trial had continued before A.R. Mohammed J. The criminal trial having commenced and reached an advanced stage, the parties therein had acquired a right to the progression and continuation of the trial. Neither of the parties to the proceedings should suffer a deprivation of that right without a hearing, especially, where, as in this case, the defendant has secured an advantage from the prosecution cross-examining its PW4, which advantage may be lost if the trial restarts. The decision of a Judge to deprive the parties of that right by recusing himself from continuing the trial can only be made after affording all the parties the opportunity to be heard on the need for his or her recusal. I do not agree with the argument of Learned Counsel for the 1st respondent that A.R. Mohammed J was right in suo motu recusing himself from trying the case without hearing the parties on the issue and that he need not do so.  The decision of this Court in Estisione H. Nig Ltd & Anor v. Osun State Government & Anor 2012 LPELR - 7938 CA relied on by Learned Counsel as stating that a Judge can suo motu recuse himself from an ongoing trial without hearing the parties on the need for such recusal did not decide so. This Court in that case restated the grounds upon which a Judge can recuse himself from a case. The exact text of the core of that decision reads thusly-  “This case is unique in the sense that it is not a case where a trial Judge has been asked to disqualify himself from further participation in the proceedings or where, after a judgment or ruling had been given there was an allegation of likelihood of bias. Rather the learned trial Judge took the initiative and disqualified himself suo motu. Ordinarily this should not cause any aggravation because ethically, a Judge has a duty to recuse himself from proceedings where the factors enumerated by learned counsel for the appellants and set out earlier in this judgment i.e. pecuniary or proprietary interest, relationship with one of the parties, a previous expression of an opinion about the subject matter of the dispute, a previous expression of partisanship by expressing opinions antagonistic to or favourable to one of the parties before him, exist. Section C Rule 1 of the Code of Conduct for Judicial Officers of the Federal Republic of Nigeria provides that a Judicial Officer should disqualify himself in a proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Several instances are set out therein, including those enumerated above. The instances are not exhaustive. There is no doubt, as held in the case of Ajileye Vs Fakayode 1990 5 NWLR 148 92 cited by learned counsel for the appellants, that by virtue of Section 66 b of the 1999 Constitution a party who submits his civil rights and obligations shall not be deprived of that right where the Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim unless the trial Judge is legally disqualified from taking up the matter.”  The reasons A.R. Mohammed J stated in his letter of 572019 to the Chief Judge for his recusal from continuing the trial of the case do not justify his said recusal in law.   Upon being assigned a case file to adjudicate upon, a legal duty is imposed upon the Judge to try the dispute in the case diligently and expeditiously, within a reasonable time to its conclusion, dispassionately without fear or favour. Although S.22 of the Federal High Court allows for the transfer of the case by the Judge to another, it would amount to an abdication of his judicial duty, if he suo motu or upon the application of any of the parties stops the continuation of proceedings in the case, and withdraws from continuing to adjudicate upon it and send it back to the Chief Judge for reassignment or transfer it to another Judge for reasons that are not permitted by law. The legally recognised and permitted reasons are that the facts in the case establish the existence of a real likelihood that he or she would be partial or biased in the adjudication of the case, that there is a feature in the case, such as the existence of some pecuniary or other interest of the Judge in the subject matter of the case, that make it impossible for justice to be seen to have been done or that provide a reasonable basis for suspecting that the impartiality and independence of the Court as constituted or presided over by the Judge is not guaranteed. See Womiloju & Ors v. Anibire & Ors 2010 10 NWLR 1203 545 in which the Supreme Court restated the law on the point thusly-  “Judicial bias is usually insufficient to justify disqualifying a judge from presiding over a case. To justify disqualification or recusal the Judge’s bias usually must be personal or based on some extrajudicial reason. In the case of Kenon v. Tekam  2001 14 NWLR pt. 732 pg. 12, Bias is defined as- “An opinion or feeling in favour of one side in a dispute or argument resulting in the likelihood that the Court so influenced will be unable to hold an even scale” where an allegation of bias is established by evidence or acknowledgement, it disqualifies a judge from participating in the matter placed before him.  An allegation of bias or likelihood of bias against a judge is usually a very serious matter not to be taken with nonchalance. It must be supported by clear, direct, positive, unequivocal and cogent evidence from which real likelihood of bias could be inferred and not mere suspicion. For an allegation of Judicial bias against the person of a Judge to succeed, the accuser must establish his allegation on some extra judicial factorsreasons such as where such factors or reasons are absent such “perceived” judicial bias is insufficient to justify disqualifying a judge from participating in a case which is properly brought before him for adjudication. The allegation cannot be founded, on mere conjecture or hearsay. On the test for determining real likelihood of bias, the Court does not look at the mind of the Justice himself or at whoever it may be who sits in a judicial capacity. It does not look to see if there was real likelihood that he would, or did in fact favour one side at the expense of the other. The Court looks at the impression which would be given to the other people. Even if he was as impartial or could be, nevertheless if right minded persons think that in the circumstances there was a real likelihood of bias on his part, and then he should not sit. And if he does sit, his decision cannot stand. The reason is plain enough. Justice is rooted in confidence and confidence is destroyed when right-minded people go away thinking that the judge was biased. Where the conduct of a judge or tribunal is impugned, the Court or tribunal is not concerned with whether judgeadjudicator was in fact biased. Where even the evidence adduced has pointed strongly to the inference that a judge or adjudicator was infact biased, the Court confines itself to the determination of whether a likelihood of bias has been established. The question is always answered by inference drawn from the circumstances of the case. The reason for this attitude of the Court is that it would be unseemly for the Court to purport to pry into the state of mind of any judicial officer.”  Allegations in an online news medium that in June 2019 the Judge trying the criminal case has been bribed with foreign currency in the sum equivalent to 500 million naira by the appellant to quash the charge against him when it comes up on 9th and 10th July 2019, which allegation is not made by any of the parties to the case and has been held by the same Judge to be false, spurious and absurd, not being established, therefore remaining mere allegation, do not show the existence of a reasonably real likelihood that the Judge would be biased or partial in the trial of the case.  In any case, non of the parties applied for the recusal of the Judge from continuing the hearing of the case. The proceedings of the trial Court on 6-6-2016 show that the same A.R. Mohammed J had on that day recused himself from continuing the trial of the case for a similar reason. The proceedings of that day read thusly- Court- My attention has been drawn to a publication in the Sahara Reporters of Friday, the 27th of May, 2016 alleging that the 1st Defendant in this matter had entered a financial agreement with me to give him a soft landing in the trial of this case. I now call upon both the prosecution and the defence to comment on this development, before the Court could take a decision on this issue. Jacobs SAN- It is a pity that such report was made. I have noted that no Court is singled out in Nigeria today from this kind of allegation. If it is every publication that the Court can disqualify itself, then the Court would not do any work. Personally, I did not see anything wrong in the way this case is being handled. We have full confidence on the Court because it is handling the matter professionally. It will cost government money because we have brought witnesses from Lagos and Benue. It will therefore prejudice the prosecution. I urge the Court to conclude this case. Daudu SAN- I urge the Court not to take anything Sahara reporters said seriously. They have made allegations against me personally. If the Court refuse to handle the case now, then it is a cheap blackmail. Sahara reporters have no address where you can serve them process. The only way the Court can disqualify itself if the Court prejudged the case or there is proof of pecuniary interest. I therefore associate myself with the prosecution that it would be tedious to start the case all over again. Onoja Esq- I agree in total with the submission of the learned senior counsel for the prosecution and the defence. My own view is that the publication is the handiwork of mischief makers bent on truncating this trial. It would work serious hardship on the 2nd Defendant if the Court recluse itself from the trial of the case. I align myself with the learned silk and urge the Court to continue with the case. This is because we have a lot of respect on the integrity of this Court. Court- It is correct that the publication ought not be taken seriously because it is the trend these days, that is, to accuse a Judge handling a matter of all sorts of wrongdoing. It has happened to the learned justices of the Supreme Court of Nigeria and the Court of Appeal by the same Sahara reporters. In comparison to these eminent jurists, Justice Mohammed, presiding at this level, is certainly an inconsequential personality.  However, my worry, and which is fundamental, is “justice or the fairness in it”, is not as the judge, or the prosecution or the defence has seen it. No. it is a cardinal principle of the fair trial that a reasonable man sees it as being fair. The allegation is now in the “public domain”. Whatever this Court would do eventually, may be capable of different interpretation by the “reasonable man out there” for or against the publication. Let me illustrate. If the Defendants are convicted at the end of the trial, whatever evidence the prosecution brought to secure the conviction would be lost on the reasonable man, because, as far as he is concerned, the publication has intimidated the Judge to hand down the conviction.  If, on the other hand, the Defendant are not convicted, the same reasonable man would then say, “we know of the allegation long ago”. In this situation, the judge is caught-off in-between, so that whatever his decision turns out to be, the reasonable man or public may not appreciate it.  What should be considered and borne in our mind is that the allegation came in the course of the case. I agree that the matter has gone a bit far, but it is still the case of the prosecution the Court is considering. My honest and sincere view is that it is better to excuse myself from this case rather than continue with it. Parties should appreciate the fact that the allegation in a way has affected the institution of the Federal High Court, therefore it is better to allow the matter go before another judge to start afresh than to remain in this Court.  It is for the above reasons that I hereby remit the case file of this matter to the Hon. Chief Judge for re-assignment to another Judge in the overall interest of justice.  The record of this appeal contain the decision of the Chief Judge rejecting the recusal and returning the file back to A.R. Mohammed J to try. The decision reads thusly-  I have seen your representation on this matter. The prosecution team and the defence team led by Rotimi Jacobs and J. Daudu came to my chambers and intimated me of this development and they expressed confidence in you to do justice to this case. The prosecution also said that it will cause hardship for him to have get his witnesses to testify again. I quite agree with him and the defence counsel that it will cause hardship to the prosecution and the defence counsel to have to start this case de novo which had gone far. We should not be cowed down by sponsored Newspaper publications in the performance of our duties. I therefore see no reason why you cannot sit on this case to its logical conclusion without fear or favour.  I hereby return this case file to your lordship to hear and conclude the matter.  The above reproduced records of this appeal show that all the parties expressed their confidence in the impartiality of the Judge in the matter and urged him to go on with the trial of the case, that A.R. Mohammed J himself held that the allegations do not deserve being taken seriously and the Chief Judge said there was no reason why he cannot continue the trial of the case to its logical conclusion and that Judges should not be cowed down by sponsored newspaper publications of obvious falsehood in the performance of their judicial duties. Such whimsical and malicious allegations, by faceless and anonymous persons in an on-line medium, considered by all parties to be false and adjudged by the Judge against whom they were made as false, absurd and not serious cannot be a legally recognised basis for recusing himself from continuing with the trial of the case.  There is no doubt that allegations of judicial corruption against a Judge in the news media, even though obviously false, baseless, illogical, unreasonable and malicious, easily disrepute the Judge as it generates odium against him by a pubic that is more excited by such allegations. As a popular Woloff proverb says, “sai sai the fool has not spoken the truth, but he has spoilt the mind”. Such allegations are bound to traumatise and psychologically harass the Judge and his or her family. But should Judges simply abdicate their judicial duties whenever such allegations are made against them. Certainly not. If that is allowed, no case would be conclusively tried by any Judge. While suffering the psychological pain of such allegation in any case, their oath of office, code of judicial conduct and the Constitution binds them to continue the hearing of the case to conclusion, if there is no reasonable basis for any of the parties to the case to fear that he is likely to be biased or partial. The fear the allegation has generated in the mind of the Judge cannot be a valid basis for the Judge to abandon his judicial duty to try the case by recusing himself from trying the case. The fear nursed by the Judge is whimsical and baseless since he has adjudged the allegations as false, baseless and absurd and both parties insist that they have confidence in the impartiality of the Judge. In any case, the Judge’s fear that the parties are likely to suspect his impartiality is not recognised in law as a valid ground for his refusal to do his judicial work. The law requires the Judge to hear and determine all cases before him or her without any fear. The refusal of A.R. Mohammed J to continue the trial of the case cannot be justified in law and in fact.  It is noteworthy that on 662016 when A.R. Mohammed J sought to recuse himself from trying the case, all parties pleaded with him to continue the trial of the case, assured him of their confidence in his impartiality and drew his attention to the fact that they would suffer hardship if the matter is tried de novo before another Judge. When he did not heed their pleas and recused himself and returned the case file to the Chief Judge, all the parties again went to the Chief Judge to plead with him to reassign the case back to A.R. Mohammed J to continue the trial of the case as to start it de novo would cause hardship to all of them and they restated their confidence in the fair trial of the case by A.R. Mohammed J. The Chief Judge heeding their pleas reassigned the case to A.R. Mohammed J, who obeyed the directive of the Chief Judge and continued the trial of the case. Then on 572019 he wrote to the new Chief Judge, returning the case file to him for reassignment on the ground that he had recused himself from trying the case. It is obvious from the record of this appeal that Auta CJ was the Chief Judge that refused the first recusal by A. R. Mohammed J and directed him to continue the trial of the case, that Auta CJ was no longer in office when A.R. Mohammed J for the second time recused himself from the case and that the new Chief Judge approved his recusal and reassigned the case to O.E. Abang J. It is curious that A. R. Mohammed repeated his recusal from the case with the advent of the new Chief Judge on the ground of a repeat of the same false allegation in the same online medium by anonymous persons against him. He disregarded the existing directive of the then Chief Judge that he continues trying the case and should not allow himself to be cowed down by such obviously false and unreasonable allegations, as all the parties to the case have continued to affirm their confidence in his ability to try the case impartially.  Against the background of the insistence by all the parties that he continues the trial of the case to avoid them suffering the hardship that a trial de novo would entail and their assurance of their confidence that he would try the case fairly, A.R. Mohammed J’s repeated refusal to continue the trial of the case, could not have been meant to further the ends of justice in the case. The recusal clearly impairs the expeditious and economic trial of the case. To avoid this kind of reaction to allegations of judicial corruption by a Judge concerning his conduct of a case before him, the law has established objective criteria on the nature of the allegations and expressions of lack of confidence in the impartiality of the Judge that can result in a Judge recusing himself or herself from hearing or continuing the hearing of a case. See Womiloju & Ors V Anibire & Ors supra Olue V Enenwali 1976 All NLR 70 and Estisione H. Nig Ltd & Anor v. Osun State Government & Anor supra.  Let me now consider the question of whether the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court should have returned the case file to A.R. Mohammed J and directed him to continue trial of the case or was right to have reassigned the case to another Judge, O.E. Abang J to try it de novo, since A.R. Mohammed had no legally valid reason for refusing to continue trying the case. The Chief Judge to whom the letter of 5-7-2016 was written by A.R. Mohammed J returning the case file, should have followed the footsteps of his predecessor, Chief Judge I.N. Auta and returned the case file to A.R. Mohammed J directing him to continue with the trial of the case. The Chief Judge’s approval of A.R. Mohammed J’s unilateral refusal to continue hearing the case for no valid legal reason and his reassignment of the case to another Judge, O.E. Abang J to try the case de novo violates the fundamental rights of the defendants in the case to a fair trial within a reasonable time, as the trial of the case that had progressed to the extent that four prosecution witnesses had testified would have to be started de novo, thereby protracting the trial of the defendants. The reassignment of the case to another Judge, disregards the hardship that a trial de novo would cause the prosecution in terms of the obvious expense and difficulties it would be put into in order to secure the attendance of the four witnesses that had already testified.  The Chief Judge’s approval of A.R. Mohammed J’s refusal to continue the trial of the case and the reassignment of the case to another Judge gives the impression that a Judge is not mandatorily bound to try a case assigned to him or her to a logical conclusion and has the choice of trying it or refusing to try it. Such a notion if accepted, would defeat the provisions of S.361 of the 1999 Constitution which requires that a case be heard and concluded within a reasonable time and render the due process of administration an uncertain journey and a sham. The convenience of a Judge and his choices do not constitute the justice of the case and should not be allowed to defeat the justice of each case and the due process of administration of justice.  The administration of a Court must pursue the sole objective of promoting the ends of justice in each case that comes to the Court and should not treat the convenience and choices of a presiding Judge as more important than the justice of the case. I agree with the submission of Learned SAN for the appellant that the trial Court per O.E. Abang J erred in law when it held that a Judge who voluntarily recuses himself or herself from trying a case cannot be compelled to try it. A Judge has no right or power to pick and choose according to his convenience, which, amongst the cases assigned to him, to try or not try. He or she has no such choice in law.  “The Chief Judge’s approval of A.R. Mohammed J’s recusal from continuing the trial of the case and reassignment of the case to O.E. Abang J has the effect of a transfer of the case from A.R. Mohammed J to O.E. Abang J. Therefore the Chief Judge should have shown a regard to the provisions of S.981 and 2 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act in approving the recusal and reassigning the case. The exact text of these provisions read thusly- “98-1 The Chief Judge of High Court may, where it appears to him that the transfer of a case will promote the ends of justice or will be in the interest of the public peace, transfer any case from one Court to another. 2 The power of the Chief Judge referred to in subsection 1 of this section shall not be exercised where the prosecution has called witnesses”.  As the facts of this case show, the reassignment or transfer of the case to O.E. Abang J because of the fears of A.R. Mohammed J on account of the false allegations of corruption against him could not have been intended to promote the ends of justice in the case as it disregards the facts that four witnesses had already testified for the prosecution and a trial de novo would inflict avoidable hardship on the parties. There are no facts to show that the demands of justice in the case made it compelling to transfer or reassign the case to O.E. Abang J in spite of the fact that four witnesses had already testified for the prosecution.  I do not agree with the submission of Learned SAN for the appellant that the transfer of part heard cases is absolutely prohibited by Section 982 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act. This provision cannot be read as placing an absolute ban on the transfer or reassignment of a part heard criminal case from one Judge to another by the Chief Judge. Being a legislation that prescribes the procedure to be followed in criminal trials, the word “shall” in subsection 2 of Section 98 should be read as giving a permissive power to choose to do so or not to do so, according to the dictates of the justice of the case, having regard to the fact that witnesses have already testified for the prosecution. It prescribes a guide for the exercise of the discretion vested in the Chief Judge by Section 193 and 4 of the Federal High Court Act and Subsection 1 of S.98 of Administration of Criminal Justice Act. This is the meaning that the said words of the provision can reasonably bear. In any case, it is settled law that mandatory words in statute prescribing procedure are not read as mandatory and sacrosanct. See Mobil Oil Producing UNLTD V LASEPA 200218 NWLR Pt.798 1 and Port Harcourt Refining Co. Ltd v. Okoro 2010 LPELR - 4861 CA. It is for this reason that mandatory words such as shall in rules of procedure are not treated as permissive and not mandatory and sacrosanct as the justice of the case permits. See Alaribe v. Nwankpa & Ors 1999 4 NWLR Pt 600 in which this Court per Ikongbeh JCA of blessed memory adopted the holding of the English Court in Liverpool Bank v. Turner 1860 30 LJ, Ch. 379 to 381 cited by Craies in his Treatise Statute Law, 4th Edition, p.233 that “No universal rule can be laid down for the construction of statutes as to whether mandatory enactments shall be considered directory only or obligatory with an implied nullification for disobedience. It is the duty of Courts of justice to try to get at the real intention of the legislature, by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute to be construed. See also Katto v. CBN 1991 11 - 12 SC 178, Oloba v. Akereja 1988 3 NWLR Pt. 84 528 and Obi v. INEC & Ors 2008 1 - 2 SC 23.  However, failure to have regard to the requirements of Section 981 and 2 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act in transferring or reassigning a case, would render such a transfer or reassignment arbitrary, capricious and not serving the ends of justice. Where the circumstances of the case disclose features that show that the Judge trying a case is palpably partial and biased or has continued to show disregard for rules of fair hearing and even law or is hostile against one party or has already determined the case or made up his mind or has become unfit to carry on his judicial duties and that allowing him to continue the trial of the case would result in a serious miscarriage of justice that might be difficult or impossible to remedy, the Chief Judge should be able to transfer the case to another judge. The reading of S.982 as absolutely prohibiting the transfer of part heard cases, would in the circumstances listed above, be unreasonable and result in impracticality, absurdity and injustice. As stated in Synopsis 2 by Sir Vahe Bairamian at paragraph 1 page 1: Assumptions; aim: The Courts have to ascertain the meaning of a statute before they can apply it, and in this task they are guided by certain principles which are described rules of interpretation or construction. They assume, as matter of commonsense, that a legislator 1 uses the right words to express his intention 2 is reasonable and consistent and 3 legislates with a practicable object in view. The first aim is to arrive at an interpretation which the words of the statue can fairly bear and which yields a practicable result with due regard to the object of the statue; and the ultimate aim is to arrive at an interpretation which achieves harmony among the provisions of the statute as a whole, and which also produces consistency with relevant provisions, if any, in other statutes.\"  As held in Okumagba v. Egbe 1965 1 All NLR 62 adopting the statement in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes 10th Ed. at page 6- “Judges are not always prepared to concede as plain language that which involves absurdity and inconsistency”. The Supreme Court in Awolowo v. Shagari & Anor 1979 All NLR 120 held that “It is a cardinal principle applicable to all kinds of statutes that you may not for any reason attach to a statutory provision a meaning which the words of that provision cannot reasonably bear.”  If Section 982 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act is read as meaning that the Chief Judge has no power to transfer a part heard criminal case from one Judge to another, it would render it inconsistent with the provisions of Section 193 and 4 of the Federal High Court Act which gives the Chief Judge the power to determine the distribution of the business before the Court amongst the Judges thereof and assign any judicial function to any Judge or Judges in respect of a particular cause or matter in a judicial division and which subjects the sitting of any Judge for the trial of any civil or criminal case to the direction of the Chief Judge. If so read as an absolute ban of the power to transfer part heard criminal cases, then Section 982 of ACJA would curtail or reduce the wide power given to the Chief Judge in all cases. Such a meaning would render it inconsistent with Section 193 and 4 of the Federal High Court Act. The meaning that would render Section 982 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act consistent with Section 193 and 4 of the Federal High Court Act is that it guides the Chief Judge on how it should exercise the discretionary power vested on it by Section 193 and 4 of the Federal High Court Act. It is a trite principle of interpretation that a statute must be read in a manner that makes it consistent or in substantial conformity with other States on the same subject matter. The statutes of a State on its Court system are read together as a single code. See Ejoh v. IGP 1963 1 All NLR 250, Aluko v. R 1903 1 All NLR 398, Akaighe v. Idama 1964 1 All NLR 322, Ariyo v. Ogele 1968 1 All NLR 1 at 6 Mabera v. Obi 1972 1 All NLR Pt. 2 336 and Appraiser v. NRC 1964 1 All NLR 63. This meaning is consistent with the object of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act as a procedural legislation to provide for how the power and jurisdiction of the Court is to be exercised and not to curtail or increase it.  This approach is purposive and teleological. The Court in interpreting the provision of a legislation must be progressive in its approach, beginning with an adherence to the express words of the said provision, and, considering if the literal meaning of those words does not defeat the intendment or object of the statute or produce injustice. If the literal meaning of the expressed words defeat the intendment of the statute or yield injustice or absurdity, then that is not the meaning that the said words can reasonably bear.  In the light of the foregoing, I hold that the decision of this Court in FRN v. Lawan 2018 LPELR - CAA717C2017 that subsection 2 of S.98 Administration of Criminal Justice Act absolutely prohibits transfer of part heard cases and does not permit of the exercise of discretion by the Chief Judge was reached per incuriam. I therefore depart from it.  Let me consider if Subsections 3 and 4 of S.98 of Administration of Criminal Justice Act should have been followed by the Chief Judge before reassigning the case to O.E. Abang J. The exact text of S.983 and 4 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act read thusly- “3. Where the Chief Judge is to exercise this power subsequent to a petition, the Chief Judge shall cause the petition to be investigated by an independent body of not more than three reputable legal practitioners within one week of receipt of such petition. 4. The investigating body shall submit its report within two weeks of appointment except otherwise specified.”  It is clear from the express words of Section 983 and 4 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act that the provisions apply only if a petition is written to the Chief Judge opposing the trial or continued trial of a case by a Judge. In our instant case, no such petition was written to the Chief Judge who reassigned the case to another Judge because A.R. Mohammed J, who was trying the case recused himself from continuing the trial of the case and returned the case file to the Chief Judge for reassignment. So the condition precedent for the application of Section 983 and 4 does not exist in this case. Therefore it cannot apply here.  However, it is doubtful if an external body outside the judiciary as constituted by the 1999 Constitution can investigate allegations of judicial corruption or misconduct against a Judge in an ongoing case so as to enable the Chief Judge exercise its discretionary power to transfer or not transfer the case from the Judge. It is equally doubtful if a body outside the judiciary, not being the Judicial Service Commission of a State or the National Judicial Council as the case may be, can investigate allegations of judicial corruption or any misconduct against a Judge of a High Court or any other judicial officer for that matter. Another doubt is whether such a body not being part of the Court before which a case is pending, can validly investigate matters that form part of the issues in an ongoing judicial proceedings before the Court. I will not determine these issues here because the parties herein have not had the opportunity of addressing this Court on them.  Let me now consider if O.E. Abang J should have refused the directive of his Chief Judge to try the case and returned the case file to A.R. Mohammed J for continuation of the trial as the defendants prayed for in their application in the trial Court and as the appellant has continued to argue in this appeal.  O.E. Abang J in his ruling held that “making an order returning the case file to the Hon. Chief Judge of this Court for same to be returned to Hon. Justice A.R. Mohammed will be an affront to the authority of the Hon. Chief Judge of this Court.” Learned SAN for the appellant has argued that this holding is not correct and that if O.E. Abang J made such an order judicially, it could not be construed as an act of insubordination. This argument ignores the law that the Federal High Court constituted by any Judge of the Court is one and the same Court and the provisions of Section 193 and 4 of the Federal High Court Act as follows- “3 The Chief Judge shall determine the distribution of the business before the Court amongst the Judges thereof and may assign any judicial function to any Judge or Judges or in respect of a particular cause or matter in a Judicial Division. 4 Subject to the directions of the Chief Judge, every Judge of the Court shall sit for the trial of civil and criminal causes or matters and for the disposal of other legal business the Chief Judge may think fit.”  The distribution of judicial work between the Judges of the Court does not affect the jurisdiction of the Court constituted by any of the Judges of the Court to try any of the cases and touches on the management of the hearing of the cases brought to the Court in its competent jurisdiction.  By virtue of the provision of Section 193 and 4 of the Federal High Court Act, O.E. Abang J was bound to comply with the directions of the Chief Judge reassigning the case to him for trial. O.E. Abang J has no power to review the manner A.R. Mohammed J recused himself from the case and how the Chief Judge exercised his discretion to reassign the case to him. Even though the reassignment of the case to O.E. Abang J is obviously arbitrary, unreasonable and does not promote the ends of justice, the Judge cannot refuse to comply with the direction of the Chief Judge.  Issue No. 1 is resolved in favour of the appellant. Issues Nos. 2 and 3 are resolved in favour of the 1st respondent.  Let me deal with another feature in this case that was brought to our attention during the hearing of this appeal. That feature is the fact that 3 prosecution witnesses have already testified in the trial de novo before O.E. Abang J and the trial is ongoing. All parties to this appeal agree on this fact. We asked the parties to address us on whether this appeal still serves any useful purpose beyond being an academic exercise, now that the trial de novo has progressed to the stage that 3 prosecution witnesses have already testified. Learned SAN for the appellant argued that the fact that the trial de novo commenced and has progressed thus far does not render this appeal useless and academic, that the appeal seeks to show lack of jurisdiction of the trial Court constituted by O.E. Abang J to try the case and that therefore if it is held that the said Court as so constituted has no jurisdiction to try the case, then the entire trial de novo proceedings including the testimonies of the 3 prosecution witnesses would be a nullity for lack of jurisdiction. Learned Counsel for the 1st respondent argued replicando that the commencement and progression of the trial de novo has rendered the appeal useless and an academic exercise.  Let me now determine the merits of this arguments.  By virtue of Order 7 Rule 4 of the Court of Appeal Rules 2016this Court can decide an appeal on a ground not contained in the notice of appeal provided the parties to the appeal are given reasonable opportunity to address this Court on the said ground. The exact text of Order 7 Rule 4 reads thusly- “Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions the Court in deciding the appeal shall not be confined to the grounds set forth by the Appellant; Provided that the Court shall not if it allows the appeal, rest its decision on any ground not set forth by the Appellant unless the Respondent has had sufficient opportunity of contesting the case on that ground.”  In any case where in an ongoing proceedings before this Court, or indeed any other Court, an event occurs, that renders the proceedings useless and an academic exercise, the Court can, either at the instance of any of the parties to the case or suo motu, determine the competence of such proceedings after giving each party to the case, the opportunity to be heard on the issue.  The Court cannot ignore such an issue for any reason and proceed to engage in the determination of the merits of the case, which determination may not add any value to or change the position of the claimant or appellant, even if his case succeeds. Where such an issue arises, it touches on the jurisdiction of the Court to try the dispute and the competence of the action.  The trite principle of law which is of considerable antiquity is that Courts have no jurisdiction to entertain and try academic questions as such questions have no life in them and have no practical value or effect, except to engage in arid and or barren theorization. See Imegwu v Okolocha & Ors 2013 LPELR -19886 SC and Okotie- Eboh V Manager & Ors 2004 20 NSCQR 214.  The applications of the defendants in the trial Court sought to restrain O.E. Abang J from commencing and trying the case de novo. After dismissing the applications and upon holding that he was bound by the directive of the Chief Judge reassigning the case to him to hear the case, O. E. Abang J proceeded immediately to commence the trial de novo on 30-9-2019 before this appeal was filed on 7-10-2019. I have considered that since the trial Court, as constituted by O.E. Abang J has the jurisdiction to try the case, and since trial de novo has commenced and is progressing expeditiously, it would rather further protract and complicate the trial of the case to send it back to A.R. Mohammed J, to continue the trial of the case, considering that A.R. Mohammed J has persisted in an unjustified reluctance and refusal to continue the trial of the case, and thereby abdicated his judicial duty. I have also considered that it could be better to focus on the expeditious trial of the case by the Court presided over by O.E. Abang J who has demonstrated a dispassionate and diligent commitment to the trial of the case with commendable judicial courage and comportment. But this appeal has shown that A.R. Mohammed’s recusal from trying the case is not in accordance with law and would not serve the ends of justice. Considering that 4 prosecution witnesses had already testified before A.R. Mohammed J, that all parties to the case have consistently expressed their confidence in his impartial trial of the case, that no injustice would be caused any party if A. R. Mohammed J continues the trial of the case and to prevent or control the abusive use of false allegations against a Judge trying or hearing a case to cause the recusal of the Judge from trying the case and thereby instigate the trial of the case de novo and frustrate the expeditious trial of the case within a reasonable time, I think that A.R. Mohammed J should continue trying this case at the trial Court.  In the light of the foregoing, I hold that the expeditious progression of the trial de novo has not rendered this appeal useless and academic and has only created a valid and credible alternative situation and foisted on this Court the duty to choose between the two situations.  On the whole, this appeal succeeds in part. It is hereby ordered that O.E. Abang J should discontinue the trial of Criminal Case No. FHCABJCR3622015 forthwith and that A.R. Mohammed J continue the trial of Criminal Case No. FHCABJCR3622015 in an accelerated manner. I make no order as to costs.

    lexlegal:hasJudgement " MARY UKAEGO PETER-ODILI, J.S.C. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  This is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Enugu Division or Lower Court or Court below dated 30th June, 2014, Coram: Massoud Abdulrahman Oredola, Emmanuel Akomaye Agim, Misitura Omodere Bolaji-Yusuf J.C.A.  The Appellants herein were the appellants in the Court below and defendants in the trial Court, while the respondent was respondent in the Lower Court and the plaintiff at the trial Court.  The appellants aggrieved with the decision of the Court below have come before the Supreme Court on six grounds of appeal vide a Notice of Appeal dated 11th day of July, 2014 and filed the same day.  FACTS RELEVANT TO THIS APPEAL: The Respondent as plaintiff commenced this action at the High Court of Justice, Awka Judicial Division, in the then Anambra state of Nigeria vide a writ of summons dated 16th December, 1986. By the further Amended Statement of Claim dated 27th June, 2001, the respondent claimed against the appellants as follows:- i. A declaration that the plaintiffs are entitled to a Statutory Right of Occupancy over the said premises of Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria situate at Awka, the annual value of which is about N10.00. ii. General damages for trespass N2,000,000.00. iii. Injunction restraining the defendants by their servants, agents or workmen from further interfering with the church premises aforesaid at Awka, or in any other manner inconsistent with the ownership and or possession of the said premises by the plaintiffs. iv. Return of the properties of the church aforesaid named at paragraph 15 above or their estimated value thereof. v. Account for all the monies found to be due to the plaintiffs which the defendants collected from S.A.C. Awka or accrued to them by virtue of remaining and or utilizing the church andor by still holding out themselves as ministers of the said S.A.C. and payment to the plaintiffs or into the Court for plaintiffs' use, starting from the 29th of December, 1977 till judgment in this case.  After considering the evidence of parties and the final submissions of respective counsel, the Trial Court entered judgment for the Respondent and granted all the above reliefs, except the claim for return of various vehicles by the Appellants to the Respondent which was dismissed.  Dissatisfied with the judgment of the Trial Court, the appellants filed a Notice of Appeal dated 25th September, 2007 and subsequently by leave of Court filed additional Grounds of Appeal dated 10th March, 2007.  On the 30th June, 2014, the Court below affirmed the judgment of the Trial Court, dismissing the appeal for lacking in merit hence the appeal to this Court as the appellant were dissatisfied.  On the 16th day of December, 2019 date of hearing, learned Senior Advocate, Ogwu James Onoja for the appellants adopted the amended appellants' brief of argument filed on 21102015 and deemed filed on 2642017 and in it distilled four questions for determination which are as follows:- i. Whether the High Court of Anambra State has jurisdiction on matters pertaining to trusteeship, under Part C of the Companies & Allied Matters Act? Distilled from Ground 1. ii. Whether the Court below was right in holding that the replacementchange to Trustees of SAVIOUR'S CHURCH OF NIGERIA is tantamount to change of its name to the Respondent's name, to warrant the decision that Exhibit \"C\" is prima facie evidence that the requirements for change of name under Section 680 1 - a and Section 682 of the CAMA, 1990 were complied with, when the respondent did not plead facts and lead evidence as to change of name. Distilled from Grounds 2 & 3. iii. Whether the Court below was right in holding that SAVIOUR'S CHURCH OF NIGERIA incorporated in 1961 is one and the same as the respondent which was incorporated in 1986, to warrant the decision that the respondent has the locus standi to institute and maintain this action, Issue predicated on Grounds 4 & 5. iv. Whether the respondent had proved by preponderance of evidencetheir entitlement to the land in dispute. Distilled from Ground 6.  Learned senior counsel for the appellants also adopted the reply brief of argument filed on 3620.  For the respondent, learned counsel, Ikechukwu Onuoma adopted the brief of argument filed on 1152016 and had been settled by Chief Mrs. A.J. Offiah SAN and in it formulated four issues for determination which are thus:- 1. Whether the High Court of Anambra State had jurisdiction to entertain this suit. Distilled from Ground 1 of the notice of appeal. 2. Whether the action was competent having been commenced by the respondent instead of \"SAVIOUR'S CHURCH OF NIGERIA\". Distilled from Grounds 2 and 3 of the notice of appeal. 3. Whether the appellants challenged the pleadingsevidence and or rebutted the presumptions raised by Exhibits B and C and whether the Court below was right in holding that the suit was competently commenced by the respondent as \"THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF SAVIOUR'S APOSTOLIC CHURCH OF NIGERIA\" instead of \"SAVIOUR'S CHURCH OF NIGERIA.\" Distilled from Grounds 4 and 5 of the notice of appeal. 4. Whether the Court below was right when it held that the respondent discharged the burden of proof placed on it by law and was therefore entitled to judgment. Distilled from Ground 6.  I shall make use of Issues 1 and 4 of the respondent as they are sufficient in the determination of this appeal.  ISSUES 1 AND 4: 1. Whether the action was competent having been commenced by the respondent instead of Saviour's Church of Nigeria. 2. Whether the respondent discharged the burden of proof placed on them in line with the provisions of the Evidence Act.  Advancing the position of the appellants, Learned Senior Counsel contended that the action ought to have been heard and determined by the Federal High Court and not Anambra State High Court as the suit is not just a land matter or declaration of title to land but principally revolves around the operation of associations incorporated under Part C of the Companies and Allied Matters Act CAMA 1990, and the operationapplication of the Companies and Allied Matters Act to the activities of the entities and associations.  That when an objection is raised, challenging the jurisdiction of the trial Court to hear and determine a suit before it, it is the nature of the plaintiffs claims that determines the jurisdiction of the Court. That the Court has a duty to consider the entire case of the plaintiff without limiting itself only to the prayers or reliefs contained in the writ of summons or statement of claim.  He stated that the Court has to go beyond the reliefs claimed by the plaintiff and consider the entire averments contained in the plaintiffs statement of claim. He cited A.S.T.C. v Quorum Consortium Ltd. 2009 9 NWLR pt. 1145 25 - 26; NIKA Fishing Ltd v Lavina 2008 11 M.J.S.C. 43 at 51 - 52; Oloruntoba-Oju v Dopamu 2008 34 NSCQR pt.1 176 at 215.  For the appellants, it was submitted that a close and adroit examination would reveal that the action is about a religious associationchurch whose members have disagreed among themselves, gotten factionalized, each faction registered as separate association, but are still claiming ownership of the old church called Saviour's Church of Nigeria. That Section 7 1 c of the Federal High Court Act, Cap 134, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 1990 confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal High Court in causes and matters arising from the operation of the companies and Allied Matters Act or any other enactment regulating the operation of companies incorporated under the companies and Allied Matters Act which exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court is also reinforced in Section 152 1 e of the 1999 Constitution as Amended. He cited Sken Consult v Ukey 1981 1 SC Page 1 at 14; Godwin v Okwey 2010 16 NWLR Pt. 1219 309.  That it is clear that only the Federal High Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter and not the Anambra State High Court, Awka.  Learned Senior Advocate for the appellants stated that the entire issue of change of name from Saviour's Church of Nigeria to the respondent's name was the case made out for the respondent by the trial Court and affirmed by the Court below. That the re-constitution of Trustees of an incorporated Trustees is fundamentally different from change of name, each with distinct procedural requirements as it is necessary to effect a change of name of an existing incorporated Association, Section 597 1 and 2 of the Companies and Allied Matters Act CAMA 1990 must be strictly complied with.  He stated that the respondent had a duty to lead evidence on pleaded facts in order to establish that the conditions in Sections 597 1 & 2 and 599 1 2 3 of CAMA were satisfied and these the respondent failed to do. He relied on Afolabi v W.S.W. Ltd. 2012 17 NWLR pt. 1329 286; Obulor v Oboro 2001 8 NWLR Pt. 714 25 at 32.  That the two Courts below imported the issues of change of name of Saviour's Church of Nigeria into the case, an issue that was not canvassed between the parties. He cited Calabar v Essien  1996 10 NWLR Pt. 477 225 at 249.  He stated further that the appeal is against the concurrent findings of fact of the two Courts below and a lot has been shown as to why an interference by this Court should occur. He cited Ayanru v Mandilas 2008 1 FWLR Pt. 407 439; Olaniyan v Fatoki 2013 17 NWLR Pt. 1384 474 at 492 etc.  For the appellants, it was further canvassed that on the strength of facts pleaded by the respondent on the further Amended statement of claim and the evidence on record, the incorporated entity called Saviour's Church of Nigeria is not one and the same as Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria as the two entities are separate and distinct and so as the subject matter of the dispute between the parties are vested in Saviour's Church of Nigeria, the instant action ought to have been commenced in that name and not the respondent who lack locus standi to institute and maintain the action in this appeal.  That having predicated their entitlement to the land in dispute on grant by Awka Local Government council and having gone further to aver in their Amended statement of claim that a document evidencing the said grant was issued to them, the only acceptable evidence to prove the grant or allocation is the production of a Certified True Copy of the document of grant or title in line with Sections 85 1, 89 and 105 of the Evidence Act, Cap E.14 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004. He cited Ilona v Idakwo 2003 11 NWLR pt. 830 53 at 84.  Learned Senior Advocate, Ogwu James Onoja stated that the failure to produce and tender the document of title in order to establish the claim to declaration of title to the disputed land, the respondent woefully failed to prove their entitlement to the disputed land and the premises of the church. That the production and tendering of the documents of title or grant would have afforded the two Courts below the opportunity to make enquiries as to whether the document is genuine and valid or the grantor has the capacity and authority to make the grant or whether the document has been duly executed or the grantor has in fact what he purported to grant and if the document had the effect claimed by the holder of the instrument. He relied on Atanda v Ifelagba 2003 17 NWLR Pt. 849 274 at 285.  That there is no evidence of traditional history on the record of proceedings to support the relief of declaration of title and so the two Court's below erred in holding that respondent established title to the disputed land by evidence of traditional history. He cited Anyafulu v Meka 2014 57 NSCQR 18 at 224.  Chief Mrs. A.J. Offiah SAN for the respondent submitted that the reliefs sought by the respondent at the trial Court are clearly within the jurisdiction of the High Court of Anambra state sitting at Awka, as the claim was essentially one for a declaration of title to land situate in Awka, damages for trespass into the said land and an injunctive order, return of property and accounts. That the issues joined by the parties are not companies and Allied Matters Petition subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court which new angle the appellants are trying to set up cannot fly into the arena of this appeal. He cited Akuneziri v Okenwa 2000 15 NWLR pt. 691 526; Ngige v Obi 2006 All FWLR Pt. 330 1041 etc.  That the issue of jurisdiction of the Anambra State High Court or the lack of it does not arise.  Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent stated that the validity or not of the registration or any company and allied matters was not part of the contest between the parties rather what is in issue is the ownership of the Church land situate at Awka. That the Court should uphold the concurrent findings of the two Courts below.  She contended that the respondent as plaintiff led evidence as to the pleaded fact of the change of name and the use of the said names interchangeably in general parlance.  That the appellants have not shown why this Court should interfere with the concurrent findings of the two Courts below. He relied on Umeanadu v A.G. Anambra State 2008 9 NWLR Pt. 1091 175; Mobil Producing Nig. Limited v LASEPA 2002 18 NWLR pt.789 1 etc.  For the respondent, it was submitted that the respondent as plaintiff discharged the burden of proof laid upon it by law and when the burden shifted to the appellants as defendants to prove their assertions on the issue of merger and their implicit denial of the fact that the land in dispute was held in trust. Also that DW1 contradicted himself on various other assertions thus making his testimonies totally unreliable in proof of their averments as severally found by the trial Court which an appellate Court would not be in the habit of disturbing as only the trial judge had the first hand opportunity of seeing and observing the witnesses. He cited Omisore v Anor. v Aregbesola & Ors. 2015 LPELR- 24803 SC; Emiri v Imieyeh 1999 4 NWLR Pt. 599 442.  Chief A.J. Offiah SAN contended that the respondent established by pleading and evidence the traditional history of the land and the unbroken chain of devolution from the original owners to their present ownership of the land in dispute.  In reply on points of law, the appellants submitted that the supreme Court is in as good a position as the trial Court as well as the Court of Appeal to examine documentary evidence placed before the lower Courts and draw its own inferences and come to its own conclusion. He cited Bunge v Government of Rivers State 2006 10 MJSC 135 at 184; Yaro v AC Ltd. 2007 10 MJSC 186 at 212.  In a nutshell, the foundation on which the appellant prays for the setting aside of what was done at the Court below are captured on the following pillars:- i. The nature of the matter transcended beyond mere possessory rights but also on status of trustee, trust appointment and operations of Part C of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, therefore the Anambra State High Court has no jurisdiction to hear the matter. ii. There are no facts or evidence on record that the name of Saviour's Church of Nigeria has been changed to the respondent's name and the application for re-constitution of the trustees of Saviour's Church of Nigeria is not tantamount to change of its name to the respondent's name. iii. That Saviour's Church of Nigeria incorporated in 1961 has distinct and separate juristic personality from the respondent and consequently the respondent has no locus standi to institute and maintain this action as the subject-matter in dispute in this action is vested in Saviour's Church of Nigeria. iv. The plaintiffrespondents did not by preponderance of evidence lead credible evidence in proof of declaration to title.  The other side of the coin taken by the respondent as reasons for this Court to dismiss the appeal for the following reasons:- 1. The plaintiffrespondent's case is purely one of a declaration of title to land, trespass, injunction, recovery of items of property and rendering accounts which had nothing to do with the Company and Allied Matters and the High Court of Anambra State sitting at Awka having jurisdiction to hear and determine the same. 2. That the respondent had discharged the onus placed on it by adducing credible evidence in proof of its case. 3. Respondent has the requisite locus standi to initiate this suit. 4. The pleadings and evidence, both oral and documentary, tendered in proof of the change of name of the respondent were not challenged by the appellants. 5. The appellants had not disclosed any reasonable or valid grounds to warrant the setting aside of the concurrent judgments of the Trial Court and the Court of Appeal in this case.  The appellants have brought up the issue of a lack of jurisdiction of the trial High Court of Anambra state holden at Awka contending that the matter resides properly with the Federal High Court as the matter is not just a land matter or declaration of title to land but principally revolves around the operation of associations within the Act, CAMA for short with this angle brought in into the jurisdictional discourse one is reminded that the jurisdiction of a Court including the trial Court is determined by the plaintiff's claim as disclosed in the writ of summons andor endorsed in the statement of claim. However, when evidence has been taken before the raising of the issue of jurisdiction, the Court may refer to any part thereof necessary. In this instance a reference to the plaintiffs pleadings becomes necessary to clarify any grey areas. See Tukur v Government of Gongola State NO. 2 1989 4 NWLR Pt. 117 P. 517; Mustapha v Government Lagos State 1987 2 NWLR Pt.58 539; Attorney General Kwara State v Olawale 1993 1 NWLR Pt. 272 645; Adeyemi v Opeyori 1976 9 - 10 SC 31.  In the point being stated above, I shall quote certain relevant portions of the Further Amended statement of claim as follows:- \"1. WHEREOF the plaintiffs claim from the defendants jointly and severally as follows:- a. A declaration that the plaintiffs are entitled to a statutory right of occupancy over the said premises of Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria situated at Awka the annual value of which is about N10.00. b. Declaration that the plaintiffs are entitled to the statutory rights of occupancy of the land in dispute due to numerous and positive acts of possession and ownership, extending over sufficient length of time as to warrant the inference that the plaintiffs are the true owners of the land. c. A declaration that the acts of possession and ownership by the Anambra State Government of connected land or adjacent lands Stadiums, High Court Premises, police Station, Eke Market etc. to the land in dispute are such as to render it probable that being the owners of such adjacent lands, they The State Government as owners of the land in dispute, granted same to the plaintiffs. d. General damages for trespass N2,000,000.00 two million naira. e. Injunction restraining defendants by themselves, their servants, agents or workmen from further interfering with the Church Premises aforesaid at Awka, or in any other manner inconsistent with the ownership and or possession of the said premises by the plaintiffs. f. Return of the properties of the Church aforesaid named at paragraph 15 above or their estimated value thereof. g. Account for all the monies found to be due to the plaintiffs which the defendants collected from S.A.C. Awka or accrued to them by virtue of remaining and or utilising the church and or by still holding out themselves as a ministers of the said S.A.C. and payment of the same to the plaintiffs or into the Court for plaintiffs' use starting for from the 29th of December 1977 till judgment in this case.\"  Section 39 1 and 2 of the Land Use Act, 1978 reads as follows:- \"39 1 The High Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in respect of the following proceedings: a Proceedings in respect of any land the subject of a statutory right of occupancy granted by the Military Governor or deemed to be granted by him under this Decree; and for the purpose of this paragraph proceedings includes proceedings for a declaration of title to a statutory right of occupancy. b Proceedings to determine any question as to the person entitled to compensation payable for improvements on land under this Decree. 2 All laws, including rules of Court regulating the practice and procedure of the High Court shall apply in respect of proceedings to which this Section relates and the laws shall have effect with such modifications as would enable effect to be given to the provisions of this Section.\"  Interestingly, the appellants joining issues with the respondents in their statement of defence at paragraphs 11 and 12 averred thus:- Paragraph 11: \"The defendants vehemently deny paragraph 10 of the statement of claim and put the plaintiff to very strict proof of the same. In answer to the paragraph the defendants aver that the land on which the Saviour's Apostolic Church Awka stands today was a personal gift to the 1st defendant by the Ezi-Awka Elders through their Attorney Mr. W.N. Nwobu and B.N. Echeazu. The document entitled Memorandum and dated 13th June. 1972 by the said Attorneys giving the land to the first defendant will be founded upon at trial. The area is shown verged Brown on plan no NLSAN106387. Paragraph 12: \"In further answer to paragraph 10, the defendants aver that the allegation that a title document relating to the land in dispute made out in favour of the plaintiff ever existed is not true. The land, the subject matter of this action was never given to the plaintiff by the owners.\"  Furthermore, the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal made the same finding at page 478 of the records as follows:- \".... The case of the respondent as donated by the further amended statement of claim is that late apostle Peter Ekweozor, Reverend Onyema and 4 others who were ordained ministers in the respondents church resigned their membership and ministration of the church but refused to hand over the church's properties or quit the premises as demanded by the respondent. They alleged that they have broken away from the church and proceeded to register their alleged break away church as the Saviour's Apostolic Church, Awka claiming ownership of the land on which the respondent's church was built in Awka, which land was granted to the respondent free in the 1950s by Awka Local Government council. A thorough reading of the entire averments in the Further Amended Statement of Claim leaves me in no doubt that this dispute is simply about the ownership of the land on which the respondent's church in Awka was built ...\"  I cannot but agree with learned Senior counsel for the respondent that neither by the pleadings of the respondent as plaintiff at the trial Court nor the traverse of the appellants as defendants or even by the issues joined in the contest was the suit or a petition within the Companies and Allied Matters Act which would take it to the domain of the Federal High Court. For a fact the parties had no difficulty in understanding the battle line which was one over the ownership of the Church land at Awka and the buildings thereon. The finding of the Court below well captured the scenario when it held thus:- \".... The argument of the appellants counsel that this case is about the operation of CAMA, the effect of a change of the respondent's name and the effect of the registration of the ministers from the church is also not supported by the pleadings and even evidence on record. That is the case now being introduced by the appellants based on misinterpretation of the averments in the respondent's pleadings...\"  The Court of Appeal's position was along the lines of the finding of the trial Court per Iguh J. who held thus:- \".... I must point out that this action is not an action against the plaintiffs and or the Corporate Affairs Commission who took over the legal duties of incorporation of companies, association, organisation, club etc. by the defendants challenging the competence or otherwise of the registration of the plaintiffs. It is not also shown in the pleadings filed in this suit or in evidence on record of this case that the plaintiffs were irregularly or improperly registered...\"  Again, I agree with learned counsel for the respondent that, an appellant cannot under the guise of arguing his appeal set up a new case different from what was pursued at the trial Court. It is bad in law for a party to argue on appeal, a case alien to the case fought at the trial Court. An issue, new or alien to that argued during trial is incompetent for consideration on appeal. Even where leave is sought and obtained to argue a fresh issue on appeal, such freshnew issue must be one which still resides within the general scope of the dispute between the parties and must be traceable to the pleadings and evidence. A new issue to be raised on appeal must not be one which takes the contest outside the subject matter of the litigation or one that has effect, as in the present instance, of totally changing character of the dispute between the parties. This will amount to changing the goal posts after the march has commenced. In the instant case, the issue of the registration of the respondent or the operation of the Company and Allied Matters Act were not in contest at the Trial Court and was not pronounced upon by the Trial Court because that was not the point of contest between the parties. It thus ought to be discountenanced. See Akuneziri v Okenwa 2000 15 NWLR Pt. 691 526, 2001 FWLR Pt. 35 604; Abdulraheem v Olufeagba 2006 17 NWLR Pt. 1008 265; Ngige v Obi 2006 All FWLR Pt. 330 1041; Julius Berger v Nig. L Plc v Nwagwu 2006 12 NWLR Pt. 995 518; Oke v Oke 2006 17 NWLR Pt. 1008 224.  I shall refer to another excerpt of the trial Court's decision on the jurisdiction throw up as follows:- \"...It is common ground between the parties and not in dispute that the late Rev. John Ekweozor was granted piece of land before incorporation in 1961 - Exhibit B, for the establishment of the church. The plaintiffs through PW1 stated the land granted to John Ekweozor before 1961 incorporation - Exhibit B, precisely in 1952, is the entire land now in dispute in this suit, and Akwa local government granted the land in dispute to him for the establishment of the church. The defendants through DW1 conceded that the land was granted to John Ekweozor before 1961 incorporation, but that it was in 1949 and that the land granted to John Ekweozor is a narrow piece of land which was granted to him by Ezi - Akwa community for the establishment of Apostolic Christian Church Mission. From the legendary on Exhibit V, this piece of land is shown verged green and it is stated therein to have been granted to John Ekweozor by the Awka Community...\"  The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal again went further in their analysis to state as follows:- \"Even if there is any issue which calls for consideration of the provisions of CAMA in this case, it is ancillary to the issue of title to land which was the main claim of the respondents before the Lower Court.\"  In fact, in my humble view, what I see is the attempt by the appellants positing in a sophisticated maneuver to introduce into a simple land dispute or title thereof, an exotic issue of the Companies and Allied Matters Act CAMA through the use of the name of the respondent which variously is called \"Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria\" or \"The Saviours Apostolic Church\" or Saviours Apostolic Church of \"Nigeria Eastern States\", each of which title was used interchangeably and none of the parties was in difficulty as to what or who was referred to and there remained at all times that the dispute was that of the ownership of the land and buildings thereon.  The situation is well showcased in the pleadings of the appellants who were defendants thus:- Paragraph 21:- \"The defendants deny paragraphs 8 and 9 of the statement of claim and will at the trial, put the plaintiffs to the strictest proof of the same. The defendants in answer aver that the SAVIOUR'S APOSTOLIC CHURCH has been in possession of its Church premises situate at Awka. The defendants have no church answering Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria in Awka. The premises of the SAVIOUR'S APOSTOLIC CHURCH Awka is properly delineated on a licensed survey plan No. NLSAN106387 prepared by licensed survey C.P.C. Nwosu of Agbani Road Enugu. The area of SAVIOUR'S APOSTOLIC CHURCH Awka is shown verged RED thereon.\"  Indeed, the appellants joined issues with the respondent, not on the validity or invalidity of registration or any company and allied matters, but on the ownership of the church land situate at Awka. Furthermore, the validity of the replacement of some deceased trustees was not an issue in the case at the trial Court but was only averred to show that the respondent has properly constituted trustees to institute the action. In furtherance thereof, the respondent averred in the statement of claim at the trial Court; \"The plaintiffs could not bring any action against the defendants immediately because some of the previous registered trustees of the Church had died and although prompt steps were taken by the church to replace the dead trustees, yet it was a heavy task to get new members registered. Recently, some new trustees have been registered, and that has made this suit possible. The certificate of incorporation NO. 558 of 18th March 1936 is hereby pleaded. The earlier certificate of incorporation of registered trustees dated 306612 is hereby pleaded.\"  The learned trial judge was right when he held as follows based on the pleadings and evidence before the Court: \"On issue No. 1, PW1 testified that the plaintiff are incorporated. They were incorporated in 1986. Certificate of incorporation was tendered a Exhibit C. He further testified that their church was registered in 1961 as Saviour's church of Nigeria. Certificate of this registration was tendered as Exhibit B in these proceedings. He explained that before the incorporation, they answered Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria, The Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria, Saviour Church of Nigeria and Saviour's Apostolic Church....\"  There is no faulting the contention of the respondent that it was wrong for the appellants to argue that there was no pleading or evidence that the name was ever changed when in fact there were ample averments of the interchangeable use of [different] names. However, and more importantly, that was not the issue in controversy. The appellants ought to have filed a counter claim if they perceived that it was important for the trial Court to make a declaration in that regard. The appellants did not allege in their pleading or in evidence that the respondent breached any conditions set out in Exhibit B.  A Court is a Court of both law and facts. It has no other source of generating its decision except from the facts of the case established before it. Chedi v Attorney General of Federation 2006 3 NWLR Pt. 997 308. In rendering its decision over a particular dispute, the primary duty of the Court is to fully consider conscientiously the totality of the evidence of the parties based on the issues in dispute before handing down its decision. The facts of each case constituted in the evidence before the Court, are important in determining the issues and the outcome of the case: They guide the Court in the eventual outcome of the case. See A.G. Abia State v A.G. Federation 2006 16 NWLR Pt. 1005 265. Having considered the totality of the facts pleaded, evidence led at trial, and the submissions of the appellants in their brief, the Lower Court rightly came to the conclusion vide pages 479 as follows: \"The entire claim and the case of the respondent is a case about title to land, therefore the Federal High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit since it has nothing to do with the management of the respondent.\"  The above finding concurred with that of the Trial Court which also held thus: \"I must point out that this action is not an action against the plaintiff and or the Cooperate Affairs Commission who took over the legal duty of incorporation of companies,..\"  Again at 313 of the records: \"....Suffice it to state therefore that the plaintiff in proof of their corporate existence tendered Exhibit C, which is the original of the certificate. The fact that the new certificate of incorporation - Exhibit C was issued to the plaintiffs in that name in place of the former name Saviours Church of Nigeria - Exhibit B shows that the Plaintiff were duly registered... Therefore the Plaintiffs are competent to sue.\"  The concurrent findings of the two Courts below are well founded and grounded in the law and practice and a classic case where an appellate Court is well advised to keep off any persuasion to interfere.  The matter of jurisdiction ought not to be brought up at all since there was no basis for so raising it as it is a clear case of a desperate attempt by the appellants to get through the back door what is just not on from the regular legal channel.  I shall bend back a little further in respect of the matter of the Incorporation or Registered name of the Respondent at least to fully lay to rest whatever confusion any one would be nursing as to what to bring up to the debate. I shall refer to the relevant paragraphs of the plaintiffrespondent's pleadings as follows:- \"Paragraph 6A: This Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria were known as Saviour's Church of Nigeria and were incorporated in that name as shown in the said certificate of incorporation dated 30661 and referred to at paragraph 6 above. Paragraph 6B: The plaintiffs are sometimes referred to merely as Saviour's Apostolic Church. Paragraph 6C: When the 1st defendant was ordained a priest, the plaintiffs church was known as Saviour's Church of Nigeria and incorporated as such as already stated but later incorporated as Apostolic Saviour's Church of Nigeria.\" \"Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria are, at all material times to this case, owners and in possession of the Church and its premises at Awka... Paragraph 9A: In the 1970s until the registration of the church in 1986 as Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria, the church was generally referred to as \"The Saviour's Apostolic Church\" and even sometimes as the \"Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria Eastern State with or without 'THE'. All these names were used inter-changeably but referred to what is now known as \"Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria.' Paragraph 9B: In confirmation of paragraph 9A, the plaintiffs hereby plead a welcome address at the foundation laying ceremony written and signed by the defendants, Rev. S. O. Nnam and other pastors in 1975. Paragraph 9D: Even the letter of resignation aforesaid of the 1st and 2nd defendants is written with a letter-head headed: Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria, Eastern States\" without \"The\" prefixing \"Saviour's. Paragraph 9E: The letter of resignation admitted that the General President of Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria is Apostle Ogundipe of the Church's Head Quarters at Ibadan and the Church at Awka was referred to in the letter of resignation as \"Saviour's Apostolic Church at Awka, Head Quarters, Eastern States.\"  The appellants at that material time did not deny the above details, and stated thus:- a.The registration at Corporate Affairs Commission was improper, or that b. There was no proper change of name at the time some deceased trustees were replaced by new trustees, or that c. The Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria registered in 1986 with the same registration No. 558 was a different entity.  They did not contest these details because they knew fully well that the issue under contention in the case was, and is, title to the land in dispute, so they launched straight into the established battle line. They were quite aware that the respondent is one and the same entity as \"Saviour's Apostolic Church.\" They therefore responded as follows:  \"The defendants deny paragraphs 8 and 9 of the statement of claim and will at the trial put the plaintiffs to the strictest proof of the same. The defendants in answer aver that the SAVIOUR'S APOSTOLIC CHURCH, has been in possession of its Church premises situate at Awka. The plaintiff has no church answering Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria in Awka, The premises of the SAVIOUR'S APOSTOLIC CHURCH Awka is properly delineated on a licensed survey plan No. NLSAN106387 prepare by licensed survey C.P.C. Nwosu of Agbani Road Enugu. The area of SAVIOUR'S APOSTOLIC CHURCH Awka is shown verged RED thereon.\"  The Respondent as plaintiff led evidence as to the pleaded fact of the change of name reproduced above and the use of the said names interchangeably in general parlance. At pages 231 of the records PW1 gave evidence as follows:  \"...Our church Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria was incorporated in the year 1986 with the names of the trustees to the Church. Our Church before its incorporation answers Saviour's Apostolic church of Nigeria and The Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria. We also answer Saviour's Church of Nigeria and Saviour's Apostolic Church. Before the year 1986, our church had been previously incorporated. In 1961 our church was incorporated as Saviour's Church of Nigeria ... The owners of the church and the church premises, the subject matter of this suit, is Saviour's Apostolic sic of Nigeria...\"  Under cross-examination vide pages 236 of the records, PW1 confirmed again the pleaded facts and his evidence in chief in the following words: \"Our church was first registered as Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria in the year 1961....\"  It must be noted once more that the said document was admitted without objection and marked Exhibit B. Continuing his testimony, PW1 stated at page 237; \"We incorporated the name Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria in the year 1986. We were issued with a certificate of incorporation of Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria...\"  The learned trial judge within the privileged position of watching and seeing and evaluating the demeanor of the witnesses stated thus:- \"On issue No. 1 PW1 testified that the plaintiffs are incorporated. They were incorporated in 1986. Certificate of incorporation was tendered in these proceedings as Exhibit C. He further testified that their church was registered in 1961 as Saviour's Church of Nigeria. Certificate of this registration was tendered as Exhibit B in these proceedings. He explained that before the incorporation they answered Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria, The Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria, Saviour's Church of Nigeria and Saviour's Apostolic Church....\"  The Court below held thus:-  \"...In this case the respondent tendered Exhibits B and C as evidence of the incorporation. Those certificates were issued under the lands Perpetual Succession Act Section 3 of which provides that a certificate of incorporation so issued shall be conclusive evidence that the preliminary requirements in respect of the incorporation has been complied with...”  The summary of the submissions of the appellants counsel is that the respondent has the onus to plead and prove in spite of tendering the certificates of incorporation, Exhibits B and C that the name of the respondent was changed and that the requirements for change of name were complied with. The respondent clearly pleaded the change of name in paragraph 6 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim reproduced above. In support of that averment, PW1 under cross-examination on page 249 of the record stated thus: \"....As at 30th June, 1961, a church was incorporated as Saviour's Church of Nigeria and Exhibit B was issues. The certificate No of the said incorporationRegistration is No. 558. It is the same church that was registeredincorporated on 18th March, 1986 as Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria, it was given the same number i.e. 558. I commenced or instituted this suit in 1986 after I have changed the names of the deceased trustees in Saviour's Church of Nigeria. My application to the Ministry of Internal Affairs was in respect of the change of the deceased trustees of Saviour's Church of Nigeria. My name appeared as one of the trustees in 1986 following the change of the deceased trustees. It was after inclusion of my name as one of the trustee in 1986 that we instituted this suit. Apostle Peter Ekweozor resigned from the church in 1977. Apostle Peter Ekweozor and others that resigned from the church in 1977 did not set up another church after their resignation in 1977...\"  Though PW1 stated that he applied for the change of trustees, it is clear on the face of Exhibit C that the name of the respondent was also changed... \"Throughout the pleadings, the evidence led and the submissions of the appellants counsel, the authenticity of Exhibits B and C was never challenged.\" \"In this case, there is no contrary evidence to Exhibits B and C and PW1's evidence that the association in Exhibit B is the same as the association in Exhibit C.\" \"The contention of the appellants counsel that this suit is incompetent because the suit should have instituted in the name of \"Saviour's Church of Nigeria\" instead of \"Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria\" lacks merit....\"  Assuming it were to be conceived that the appellants in their pleadings joined issues with respondent in respect of paragraphs 6A-6C, 8, 9A, 9B, 9D and 9E of the Further Amended Statement of Claim, it is submitted that the law would then require the respondent to produce proof of the juristic personality of the respondent. This burden would be discharged by the tendering of the certificate of incorporation, as rightly opined by Onnoghen, J.S.C. as he then was in NNPC v LUTIN INVESTMENT LTD. 2006 2 NWLR Pt. 965 506 at 527 where his Lordship held thus: \"...That apart, it is trite law that the only way incorporation of a company can be established in any proceeding is by tendering the certificate of its incorporation...\"  The facts on ground as borne out by the record is that the respondent conclusively discharged the burden of proof of tendering Exhibits B and C as evidence of incorporation and they pleaded in great details the change of name in Paragraphs 7, 6A to 6C, 9, 9A to 9E of the Further Amended Statement of Claim and PW1 gave evidence as to the said change of name which exhibits and evidence were not challenged. The next action called for, was for the appellants as defendants to lead evidence in rebuttal and as the Court below found and which the record of appeal have borne out, they failed to challenge. The next question is upon which would this Court disturb those findings of the Court below as the trial did.  The answer is that there is nothing on which this Court can hang an interference as there is no perversity in the findings nor a miscarriage of justice or a misapplication of the law, procedural or substantive. See Fatunbi v Olanloye 2004 6-7 SC 68; Umeanadu v A.G. Anambra State 2008 9 NWLR Pt. 1091 175 SC; Mobil Producing Nig. Ltd v LASEPA 2002 18 NWLR Pt. 789 1; Kofi v Kofi 1 WACA 284; Chinwendu v Mbamali & Anor. 1980 3 - 4 SC Reprint 21; 1980 3 - 4 SC 252; Balogun v Adejobi 1995 2 NWLR Pt. 370 131; Okonkwo v Okonkwo 1998 10 NWLR pt. 571 554.  ISSUE NO. 4: This issue needs special treatment as it poses the question whether the respondent discharged the burden of proof placed on him in line with the provisions of the Evidence Act.  To untie the puzzle, it needs reiteration that the burden of proof in civil cases has two distinct facets; the first is the burden of proof as a matter of law and the pleadings normally termed as the legal burden or the burden of establishing a case; the second is the burden of proof in the sense of adducing evidence usually described as the evidential burden. While the legal burden of proof is always static and never shifting, the other type being evidential burden of proof shifts or oscillates constantly as the scale of evidence preponderates. In resolving the first question, the primary onus of proof in a civil case such as the present one lies on the plaintiff who happens to be the now respondent.  I rely on the following cases: - KWAMINA KUMA v KOFI KUM 1934 WACA 178 AT p. 179; - KODILINYE v MBENEFO ODU 1935 2 WACA 336 AT P. 337; - AYITEY COBBLAH v TETTEY GBEKE 1947 12 WACA 294 AT P. 295; - ANACHUNA NWOKAFOR AND ORS. v NWANKWO UDEGBE AND ORS. 1963 1 ALL N.L.R. 107. - NWANKWO UDEGBE AND ORS. V ANACHUMA NWOKAFOR AND ORS. P.C. 1963 N.L .R.P. 417 AT P. 418. - MOGAJI & ORS. v ODOFIN & ANOR. 1978 4 SC 91; BELLO v EWEKA 1981 1 SC 101 AT 117 - 120.  It needs be said that the onus of proof does not exist in vacuo. The onus or burden of proof is the legal duty or obligation to prove or establish facts in relation to an issue. There cannot be any burden of proof where there are no issues in dispute between the parties. For example, if the plaintiff's claim is admitted, there will generally be no onus on the plaintiff to go into, in proof of his claim. Similarly, if a particular averment of the plaintiff is admitted, there will no longer be an onus to prove what has been admitted by the opposite party, therefore, to discover where the onus lies in any given case, the Court has to look critically at the pleadings.  Where for instance the plaintiff pleads possession of the land in dispute as his root of title and the defendant admits that possession but adds that the land was given to the plaintiff on pledge, then the onus shifts onto the defendant to prove that the plaintiff is not the owner of the land, his possession of which has been admitted. The defendant then also has the onus of proving the alleged pledge. Once the defendant admits the plaintiffs possession of the land in dispute in his Statement of Defence, there and then, the plaintiff has on the pleadings discharged the onus of proof cast on him and Section 133 2 of the Evidence Act will impose a burden on the defendant to prove that the plaintiff is not an owner but rather a pledgee. See Lawrence Onyekaonwu & Ors. v Ekwubiri 1966 1 All NLR 32 at P. 35. If at the close of his case, the said defendant fails to prove that the plaintiff is not an owner but a pledgee, the plaintiffs claim succeeds without the plaintiff giving any further evidence.  Getting back to the second question as to whether there was a misdirection in this case as to the onus of proof. In this case, the respondent briefly reviewed the pleadings and the evidence upon which the learned trial judge reached his decision which was affirmed by the lower Court.  The respondent pleaded as follows in Paragraph 10 of their Further Amended Statement of Claim: \"The land in dispute verged pink in the said survey plan is part of the property of the Awka Local Government Council which portion the Awka Local Government Council granted free, being a bad-bush, to the plaintiffs in the early 1950s. The 1st defendant's brother, Rev. John Ekweozor now deceased was one of the registered trustees of the Church in respect of all the lands of the plaintiff in Nigeria. This is apparent from the certificate of incorporation NO. 558 of 30th June 1961 already pleaded at paragraph 6 above.\"  Some excerpts from the judgment of the learned trial judge run as follows:- \"He PW1 also testified that it was in 1952 that the Local Government granted them a land for them to establish their church. The land was an evil forest where people who committed abomination were thrown into. This grant of land by Awka Local Government to them was in writing ... He further stated that it is not correct that the land on which their church is situate at Awka was granted to the defendants by Ezi-Awka elders in 1972. He explained that their church building at Awka is close to the sports stadium. Survey plan with No. ANK A 118 with tracing number ANS-K-115 dated 23rd February, 1995 was tendered in these proceedings as Exhibit M to show that the sports stadium at Awka is close to the plaintiffs' land where their church building is situated at Awka.\"  At page 324 of the records, the trial Court held thus:- “It is clear from these testimonies which I find credible and reliable that the land in dispute was granted to the church free through late pastor John Ekweozor, who is one of the trustees of Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria as can be seen from the testimonies of PW1 and Exhibit B... I also find as a fact that the Pastor John Ekweozor as a result of the merger in 1958 became a trustee of Saviour's Church of Nigeria. A mud house was build on the land in dispute where late Pastor John Ekweozor and PW1 were conducting services...\"  At page 327, His Lordship held as follows:- \"I find the evidence of PW1 on how the plaintiffs came to own the land in dispute credible and reliable, and I believe him. I find the evidence of DW1 that before 1972, the premises or compound of the 3rd defendant where the church building of thatch house was built was a narrow piece of land granted to Rev. John Ekweozor by Ezi-Awka Community in 1949 as most untruthful. The 3rd defendant's church was not located on the land in dispute before 1977. The land granted to Rev. John Ekweozor was not a narrow piece of land. The land in dispute was not granted to him in 1949. It was not also Ezi-Awka community that granted him the land in dispute, but the Awka Local Government. I find also the testimony of DW1 that in 1972, 1st defendant approached Ezi-Awka elders for additional land for their so-called growing church and they granted him his request, and granted him additional piece of land to the one they granted before as most untruthful and I disbelieve him. The original owners of the land in dispute has sic been established in evidence vide Exhibit P who granted the same to the Awka Community alongside with other parcels of land. Awka Community in turn granted the land in dispute together with other parcels of land to Awka County Council later called Awka Local Government. Awka Local Government in 1952 granted Rev. John Ekweozor the land in dispute for the establishment of a church which he held in trust as a trustee of the church .... the church later merged and was registered in 1961 as per Exhibit B, the original owners of the land were shown in Exhibit P from where the land in dispute devolved unto the plaintiffs. I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have established the traditional history of the land in dispute, which they relied on as root of title.\"  Considering yet another method by which the respondent can prove title to the land in dispute and against the background of the pleadings, the learned trial judge based on the evidence on record stated as follows at pages 330 to 331 of the Record thus:- \"Another independent witness, PW4 - Benedict Afam Odinamkpa - a civil servant of the Ministry of Lands, Survey and Urban Planning of Anambra State and a Chief Surveyor and the officer in charge of mapping and research gave evidence.... He tendered the survey plan with plan number MEC51B61 as Exhibit S and survey plan with number MISC.AS 89 as Exhibit T. He also testified that Exhibit T is a composite survey plan showing High Court premises Awka, Sports Stadium Awka, Police Station Awka, Eke Market extension Awka and Saviour's Apostolic Church premises, Awka. All the parcels of land shown on Exhibit T are Anambra State government lands. Exhibit S shows the land claimed by the plaintiffs in Exhibit P. The names the plaintiffs called the various parcels of land in Exhibit P are also shown and reflected as such in Exhibit S. Exhibit S is also titled Suit No. AA9173 with the parties on Exhibit P shown thereon. Exhibit S also has plan number MEC51B61 ... It is clear from the evidence of PW4 that all the lands shown in Exhibit T are Anambra State Government Lands. There is also Exhibit L, which shows that the plaintiff's church is located on the state land at Awka. It is however common grounds between the parties and not in dispute that the land in dispute was granted.  The learned trial judge found that the respondent had discharged the burden of proof of the grant made to them, even though the respondent's document of title was lost. The lower Court found no reason to upset the above reproduced findings of fact by the trial Court, but rather upheld the same.  With the evidence proffered by the plaintiffrespondent which the learned trial judge accepted as full discharge of the burden of proof of land upon the plaintiff which logically moved the burden to the defendantsappellants in rebuttal and DW1 in that regard stated as follows:- The agreement was oral. The name of John Ekweozor appears on Exhibit B as one of the trustees. I do not know whether John Ekweozor was alive as at the time of the application for registration of Saviour's Church of Nigeria was made. Put: John Ekweozor was alive as at the time the application was made and that is why his name appeared on Exhibit B. ANS: It is not correct.  Subsequently at page 287 of the records, the same DW1 stated: \"The application for registration of Saviour's Church of Nigeria was made when John Ekweozor had died. Based on the application made in the life time of John Ekweozor for the registration of Saviour's Church of Nigeria a certificate of registration was issued...\"  The DW1 had also similarly contradicted himself on various other assertions, thus making his testimonies totally unreliable in proof of their averments, as severally found by the trial Court. For instance, a page 293 of the records DW1 stated thus:- \"I did not in my previous evidence in this suit before Onyiuke J., on the 7th June, 2001 testify that \"I still belong to Saviours Apostolic Church. At Minna, I belong to new life winner's church. The new life winner's church pays me. I am their employee. The Saviour's Apostolic Church pays me. The two names are interchangeable.\"  The learned trial judge in reaction to the testimony of DW1 stated as follows:- \"Let me first of all point out that I carefully watched and observed DW1 testify in the witness box in this case and he appears to me not to be a witness of truth.\"  Taking along the finding of the learned trial judge in his exclusive preserve as the one judex with the privilege of seeing and observing the witness and buttressed by the records, it is clear that although late pastor John Ekweozor died in before Exhibit B was issued, it is clear from the testimonies of PW1 and subsequent admission of DW1 that the application for the incorporation of Saviours Church of Nigeria was made in his life time. It is established in evidence that some of the trustees in Exhibit B died and it took the plaintiffs time to re-organise and replace them. This led to Exhibit C.  Exhibits B and C show that they bear the same certificate number 558 which confirms continuity in the identity of the corporate personality therein. In addition, the status of late Pastor John Ekweozor from whom the DefendantsAppellants claim they derive title to part of the land in dispute as trustees of Saviour's Church of Nigeria was settled by the pleadings and established in evidence. The pleadings further show that the donation grant of land was for the benefit of the church. When Saviour's Church of Nigeria became registered as shown in Exhibit B, the land in dispute which was held in trust for the association before its incorporation became vested in the Church.  Of note is that the credibility of the witness has been brought to the fore and this Court, just like the Court below does not have the power to enter into that area since that is the exclusivity of the trial Court who had firsthand knowledge and sight of the witness whose credibility is central and so the hand of the Appellate Court such as the current is tied and the only option is to let the finding rest. See Omisore & Anor. v Aregbesola & Ors. 2016 LPELR-24803 SC; Emiri v Imieyeh 1999 4 NWLR Pt. 599 442.  At the risk of producing remark or comments that may be termed copious but really at the abundance of caution, I shall recast some excerpts of the two Courts below for elucidation.  The Court of Appeal as can be seen at page 497 of the Record stated thus:- \"...It is settled law that an Appellate Court would not interfere with the finding of fact of the Trial Court unless it is shown that the finding is perverse or not justified by the evidence on record or not right in law... from the entire evidence on record, the findings of the learned trial judge that the respondent established the root of its title as claimed cannot be faulted...\"  PW1 explained in evidence at pages 233 - 234 of the records the circumstances that make it impossible for the Respondent to get a copy of the document and tender same before the Court. PW1 stated:- \"It was in 1952 that the Awka Local Government granted us i.e. the plaintiff, a land for use to establish our church. The land was an evil forest where people who committed abomination were thrown into. I know one John Ekweozor. He is now dead. Late John Ekweozor is related to the 1st defendant who is his brother. Late John Ekweozor was the then head of our church, Saviour's Apostolic Church of Nigeria in the Eastern State. Late John Ekweozor was one of the trustees of the Church when our church was incorporated in 1961. The Awka Local Government gave us a document that shows their grant of land to us in 1952. The said document was kept by Late Pastor John Ekweozor. I know reverend John Nwofor. He was the head of our church in Awka after the Nigerian Civil was following his transfer by Apostle J.A. Ogundipe. John Ekweozor died before the civil war and was replaced by pastor John Nwofor before the Nigerian civil war. We went to Awka Local Government secretariat to see whether we could get a copy of the title documents of our land at Awka granted to us by Awka Local Government in 1952 but we were told at the Awka Local government secretariat that the documents were plat of the documents consumed by fire. It was Awka community that gave the County Council now Awka Local Government the entire land they granted to us...\"  The Court below stated thus:- \"....It will be unjust and inequitable to insist on the production of the title document and come to the conclusion that the respondent had failed to prove its title to the land in dispute for failure to produce the document of title. The worst conclusion that can be drawn is that the respondent failed to prove the land by document of title which is only one of the ways to prove title. In any case, I am of the view that failure to tender the document of grant which has been sufficiency explained is not fatal to the respondent's case. I say so because the respondent is entitled in law to plead and rely on more than one way of proving title but needs to prove only one to succeed. The law is settled that where a plaintiff establishes one of the five ways of proving title to land, it is sufficient proof of ownership of the land. See Balogun v Akanji 1988 1 NWLR pt. 70 p. 301.”  Again, the learned trial Judge had earlier captured it in his judgment at pages 322 when he held thus: \"....It is common ground between the parties and not in dispute that the late Rev. John Ekweozor was granted piece of land before incorporation in 1961 Exhibit B, for the establishment of the church. The plaintiffs through PW1 stated the land granted to John Ekweozor before 1961 incorporation Exhibit B, precisely in 1952, is the entire land now in dispute in this suit, the Awka local Government granted the land in dispute to him for the establishment of the church. The defendants through DW1 conceded that the land was granted to John Ekweozor before 1961 incorporation, but that it was in 1949 and that the land granted to John Ekweozor is a narrow piece of land which was granted to him by Ezi-Awka community for the establishment of Apostolic Christian Church Mission. From the legendary on Exhibit V, this piece of land is shown verged green and it is stated therein to have been granted to John Ekweozor by the Awka Community...\"  Taking all I have been laboring to put across in context, it is to be said that the respondent established by pleading and evidence, the traditional history of the land. The original owners of the land in dispute were established in evidence vide Exhibit P who granted the same to the Awka community alongside with other parcels of land. Awka community in turn granted the land in dispute together with other parcels of land to Awka County Council later called Akwa Local Government. The Awka Local Government in 1952 granted the land in dispute to the trustees of the respondent, Rev. John Ekweozor, for the establishment of the church which he held in trust as a trustee of the church. The church later merged and was registered in 1961 as per Exhibit B. The original owners of the land in dispute were shown in Exhibit P from whom the land in dispute developed unto the Respondents.  The Respondent thus established an unbroken chain of devolution from the original owners to their present ownership of the land in dispute. In contrast the pleadings of the appellants at paragraph 11 of their statement of Defence, the evidence in chief of DW1 and his cross-examination were contradictory and at cross purposes. The learned trial Judge who had the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses directly found as much and his findings were confirmed by the Lower Court in their judgment at pages 495-497 of the records.  The Trial Court was therefore right when having evaluated the evidence of the parties it held:- \"... I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have established the traditional history of the land in dispute, which they relied on as root of title ...\"  These findings were also confirmed by the Lower Court at pages 496 to 498 of the record when it held:- \"...The finding of the trial Judge that DW1 is not a credible witness cannot be faulted.... It is settled law that an Appellate Court would not interfere with the finding of fact of a Trial Court unless it is shown that the finding is perverse or not justified by the evidence on record or not right in law. Where the Trial Court properly evaluated the evidence and came to a right conclusion as in this case, the Appellate Court will not interfere. From the entire evidence on record, the findings of the learned trial judge that the respondent established the root of its title as claimed cannot be faulted ...\"  On the other hand, the respondent argues that the defendantsappellants averred as follows:- \"The Defendants vehemently deny paragraph 10 of the statement of claim and put the plaintiff to very strict proof of the same. In answer to the said paragraph, the defendants aver that the land on which the Saviour's Apostolic Church Awka stands today was a personal gift to the 1st defendant by the Ezi-Awka Elders through their Attorney Mr. W.N. Nwobu and B.N. Echeazu. Therefore when the defendants introduced their pleadings, issues that would convert him to be a claimantplaintiff on such issues, it is his duty to prove the existence of such facts in order to support what he claims or assets in his defence. Where he fails to do so, he will certainly be the loser on that issue. That of course is the tenor of Sections 136 and 137 of the Evidence Act. In this case, the appellants claim exclusive ownership of the land in dispute by a gift. They failed to adduce any evidence whatsoever to justify that claim. That assertion which by its nature is more than just a defence, and amounts to a claim, failed in the absence of any credible evidence to sustain the same. This leaves the plaintiff's claim Respondent herein and evidence led in support thereof to stand without any challenge. The 1st appellant at the trial Court testifying as DW1 in his testimony said that before the grant made to him, Ezi-Awka community were the owner of the land in dispute. They had pleaded in paragraph 11 of their statement of Defence that the land on which the Saviour's Church Awka stands today was a personal gift to the 1st DefendantAppellant by Ezi-Awka Elders through their Attorneys. They also pleaded therein a document titled \"Memorandum dated 13th June, 1972\" by the said attorneys allegedly giving the land therein described to the defendantappellant. The Defendants did not tender in evidence this \"Memorandum dated 13th June 1972.\"  Again, both in their pleadings and the evidence of DQ1, the appellants alleged that it is Ezi-Awka community that are the original owners of the land in dispute which they also unsuccessfully allege was a gift to 1st appellant. The land in dispute in this appeal is part of the land litigated upon in Suit No. AA9173 tendered as Exhibit P. The judgment therein is a product of an action in rem, which establishes the status of whoever won in the suit in respect of the land. It is not a personal action that dies with the parties concerned and so Exhibit P remains a subsis" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  AMINA ADAMU AUGIE, J.S.C. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  The Appellant, as second Defendant, and two other Defendants were arraigned before the Lagos State High Court on a two-Count Charge of conspiracy to commit robbery and robbery. They were alleged to have used a toy gun to attack and rob a motorcycle rider and his passenger, and dispossessed them of the sum of N500 and N1,500 respectively.  At the trial, the Prosecution called a sole Witness, Friday Ojiemen, a Policeman attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad SARS, lkeja, and he tendered the Statement made by the Appellant to the Police. However, Defence Counsel objected to the admissibility of the said Statement in evidence because \"the Defendant denied writing the Statement, the Defendant alleged duress in obtaining the Statement.\"  In the circumstances, the trial Court conducted a trial-within-trial, and after its Ruling of 2042012 wherein the Appellant's confessional Statement was admitted in evidence as Exhibit P2, it adjourned the matter to ''6th, 12th and 13th of June 2012\", for continuation of the trial.  The trial could not proceed on 662012 because the Officer that the Prosecution intended to call was away \"on a special assignment\", and 1262012 was a public holiday. On 1362012, Friday Ojiemen, who was to continue his evidence in chief as PW1, was \"not available\", and the case was adjourned to \"03072012 for continuation of trial''.  On the next date on Record, 2102012, Prosecution Counsel asked for another adjournment and the Defence Counsel opposed same. But in acceding to Prosecution Counsel's plea for one more adjournment, the learned trial Judge, I. O. Kasali, J., stated as follows at page 156 - I am reluctantly adjourning the 2007 matter at the instance of the Prosecution for the last time. I am, however, putting it on record that the Prosecution on the next adjourned must close its case by assembling all Witnesses - - to testify on the next adjourn sic date failing which the Court will close the Prosecution case and call on the Defendant to open their defence. Case adjourned to 31102012 for continuation of trial.  On 31102012 PW1 was in Court, but the Defence Counsel said he was not ready to proceed with the trial as he had \"a medical problem\".  In objecting to his application, the Prosecution Counsel stated that - We have difficulty in getting our witnesses. PW1 is a busy Officer, any attempt to adjourn will not be in the interest of justice.  PW1 continued with his evidence. A toy gun was admitted in evidence through him as Exhibit P3, and the case was \"adjourned to 6122012 for cross-examination of CW1 PW1 and open the Defendant case.\"  On 3012013, when the case came up again, PW1 was in Court, but Defence Counsel was absent. This time, the trial Court noted that: It is very unfortunate that the Defendant Counsel is not taking this 2007 matter serious. On 31102012, when he was to cross-examine CW1 he did not and he applied for a date to cross examine CW1. The matter was adjourn sic to 6122012. On 6122012, the Defendants were present, none of the Counsel were in Court, the Court did not sit as the Court was bereaved and this matter was adjourned to 1012013. On 1012013, the Defendants were also present, the Prosecutor Counsel was in Court, but the Defendant Counsel was absent, the Court did not sit, it was on the day Hon. Justice Ayo was buried and this matter was adjourn sic till today. Today, when the matter was called, the State was represented, the Defendants are present but the Defendant Counsel is equally absent. The business of the Court for today is for cross-examination of CW1 and for the Defendant to open their defence. CW1 is present. I am, however, putting it on Record that if by the next adjourn date, the Defendant Counsel is not ready to cross-examine CW1, CW1 will be discharged and the Court will call on the State to file written address. Case adjourned to 06032013 for continuation of trial. CW1 to be cross-examined by Defendant Counsel, the Defendants to open their defence.  On 632013, the Defence Counsel was absent and the trial Court said: The Court has given more than enough opportunity to the Defendant Counsel to cross-examine PW1, the only Witness for the Prosecution, yet the Defendant Counsel did not make use of the opportunity. The Application by the Assistant Chief State Counsel for the State to foreclose the right of cross examination by the Defendant counsel is meritoriding sic. I hereby close the right of the Defendant to cross-examine PW1. PW1 is hereby discharged. This matter is adjourned to 30041013 for Defence.  On 3042013, a new Defence Counsel appeared for the \"Defendant\" and sought an adjournment to get processes from the former Counsel, and the case was adjourned to 1452013 for defence. The Appellant testified as DW2 on 1452013, when the Defence opened their case. But the trial Court, in its Judgment of 142014, found him guilty as charged, and convicted and sentenced him to 21 years imprisonment.  The Appellant then appealed to the Court of Appeal, and one of his complaints against the trial Court's decision was that the trial Court had \"erred in law when it foreclosed [his] right to cross-examine PW1\". But in its Judgment delivered on 232018, the Court of Appeal held - It is obvious that adequate opportunity was given to the defence to cross examine CW1. It would have been a different thing if the Court did not bend backwards to a point of breaking just to give the Appellant on opportunity to cross examine Prosecution Witnesses. The right is not open ended. Once on opportunity is not used, the Court must move on. The Witness taken but awaiting cross examination cannot also be made to continuously appear in Court unending. I do not agree with the Appellant that he was not given on opportunity. Failure to exercise the opportunity given cannot be the fault of the Court below. Consequently, the right to fair hearing of the Appellant was not breached and he cannot be heard to complain. Trials are not overstretched merely because a Party is not ready to utilize an opportunity given for the party to take a step. Appellant was represented by Counsel on all the dates the Court below took a step in the proceedings leading to the Appellant's conviction and sentence. Furthermore, the decision taken by Counsel cannot be challenged nor questioned by the Court. Counsel had unfettered authority to handle the matter the way he deemed fit ... It is clear that the initial Counsel did not even have any regard nor respect for the Court. For all the times he was absent from the proceedings, there was no record that he wrote the Court to explain his absence. It is expected that Counsel should show respect to the Court and always write to explain absence from Court. That is simply extending courtesy to the Court and is the ideal conduct and behavior of Counsel before any Court. The Appellant cannot find refuge under fair hearing. He is bound by what the second Counsel also did, by not recalling the only witness for the prosecution. The Court cannot under any guise question that decision. Flowing from above, the issues having been resolved against the Appellant, the Appeal lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. The judgment of the trial Court decided on 142014 by Hon. justice I. O, Kasali is hereby affirmed. I make no order as to cost.  Further aggrieved, he filed a Notice of Appeal containing two Grounds of Appeal in this Court against the Judgment of the Court of Appeal.  Briefs of Arguments were filed and exchanged, and in his Brief of Argument, the Appellant formulated two issues for Determination - a Whether the Court of Appeal was right in affirming the judgment of the trial Court wherein the trial Court foreclosed the Appellant's right to cross-examine PW1, the Respondent's sole Witness. b Whether the Appellant's conviction is supported by law in view of the weight of evidence given and improper trial procedure.  The Respondent adopted the Appellant's two issues, but it noted that issue 2 is distilled from Ground 2 of the Grounds of Appeal, which says \"the judgment of the trial Court is against the weight of evidence\", and cited State v. Ekanem 2016 LPELR-41304SC, wherein this Court held that such a Ground of Appeal is improper and incompetent, and it is absolutely right; the said Ground of Appeal is clearly incompetent.  The complaint in the said Ground 2 is targeted at the trial Court; it is a ground of appeal that is fit for the Court of Appeal; not this Court, which only entertains appeals from the Court of Appeal - see Idagu v. State 2018 LPELR-44343SC. Put in simple terms, the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended, did not make provision for appeals to go directly from High Court to Supreme Court.  There is an intermediate Court, Court of Appeal, which serves as \"a clearing house\", so to speak, between both Courts. It hears appeals from the trial Court, and the trial Court's findings must be affirmed or reversed by the Court of Appeal, before its decision gets to this Court, therefore, this Court would only entertain an appeal against a decision of the Court of Appeal, and not directly against that of the High Court. - Akibu & Anor v. Oduntan & Ors 2000 13 NWLR Pt. 685 446 SC.  In the circumstances, the said Ground 2 is incompetent and must be struck out. The Appellant's issue 2 distilled therefrom is ipso facto incompetent, as an issue for determination derives its support from a ground of appeal, and cannot exist independently of the said ground; \"it automatically collapses when the ground of appeal ceases to exist\" - see Agbaka & Ors v. Amadi & Anor 1998 11 NWLR Pt. 572 16 SC.  The effect thereof is that Ground 2 of the Grounds of Appeal and issue 2 formulated therefrom are incompetent, and are struck out.  Thus, the only issue left for determination in this Appeal is whether - The Court of Appeal was right in affirming the judgment of the trial Court wherein the trial Court foreclosed the Appellant's right to cross-examine PW1, the Respondent's sole Witness.  The Appellant's contention is that his right to cross-examine a witness, is within the rubric of his fundamental right to fair hearing guaranteed by Section 36 1 of the 1999 Constitution as amended, citing Eze v. FRN 2017 LPELR - 42097 SC, Udo v. State 1988 LPELR -3299 SC. He also cited Section 366 b & d of the Constitution, and Section 233 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law [ACJL] of Lagos State 2011, on the \"Non-appearance of Defendant's Counsel\", which says: 1. Where the legal representative of the Defendant ceases to appear in Court, the Court shall after a reasonable period of non-appearance enquire from the Defendant if he wishes to engage another Counsel arranged by him or a Counsel engaged by way of legal aid. 2. The Court shall allow the Defendant to make his own arrangement if he indicates to do so. 3. In circumstances where a Defendant fails or is unable to secure legal representation, the Court shall have power to order that the Defendant be represented by way of legal aid.  He argued that the appropriate step the trial Court should have taken when the defence Counsel was absent, was to direct him, Appellant, to appoint another Counsel or he should represent himself, therefore, the Court of Appeal erred when it affirmed the trial Court's decision, citing Udo Akpan Udofia v. The State 1988 LPELR-3305 SC 14-16.  Citing Nwabueze v. People of Lagos State 2018 LPELR-44113 SC, Bamgboye v. Unilorin 1999 10 NWLR Pt. 622 290, and Okafor v. AG., Anambra State 1991 6 NWLR Pt.200656, he submitted that the effect of a breach of fair hearing is that the whole trial is vitiated, and rendered null and void, therefore, the denial of fair hearing to him is incurably fatal to the trial Court's Judgment, so it must be set aside. Kalu v. State 2017 LPELR - 42101 SC, MFA & Ors v. Inongha 2014 LPELR -22010 SC, FMBN v. Adu 2000 11 NWLR Pt. 678 309, and Tukur v. Govt., of Gongola State 1989 4 NWLR PT. 117 577 cited.  He also submitted that one of the pillars of fair hearing is equal opportunity to cross examine witnesses; that it is a constitutional right of a Defendant to be allowed to cross-examine a Prosecution witness; that a breach of same is a breach of the right of fair hearing, which can have a disastrous effect on the Judgment and it has been held that - This right of cross-examination is considered to be of fundamental importance in the trial process and any attempt by the trial Court to deny or circumscribe the right of a Party to cross-examine his adversary's witness or witnesses, in any manner whatsoever, is frowned upon by the appellate Court and treated as a breach of fair hearing. See Iwuoha v. Okoroike 1996 2 NWLR PT.429 231; Tewogbade v. Agbabiaka 2001 5 NWLR PT. 705 38, and Psychiatric Hospital Management Board v. Edosa 2001 5 NWLR Pt. 707 sic.  He also argued in the alternative that assuming but not conceding that the trial Court was right in foreclosing his right to cross-examine PW1, the failure to cross-examine him was not his, but rather his Counsel; and it is trite that a Party cannot be held responsible andor punished for the mistake of his counsel, citing Adegbite & Anor v. Amosu 2016 LPELR 40655 SC, Shanu v. Afribank 2000 13 NWLR PT. 684 392, Chime & Anor v. Nelson Ude & ORS 1996 7 NWLR PT. 461 376 SC.  On this issue, the Respondent cited Nwokocha v. AG., Imo State 2016 LPELR-40077 SC, on the meaning of the term \"fair hearing\", and submitted that Appellant was represented by Counsel, who chose to continue with the defence rather than apply to have PW1 recalled. It cited Adebayo v. AG., Ogun State 2008 7 NWLR Pt. 1085 201, wherein this Court per Tobi, JSC, so very fittingly, observed as follows:  Learned counsel for the Appellant roped in the fair hearing principle. I have seen in recent times that Parties, who have bad cases embrace and make use of the constitutional provision for fair hearing to bamboozle the adverse Party and the Court, with a view to moving the Court away from the live issues in litigation. They make so much weather and sing the familiar song that the constitutional provision is violated or contravened. They do not stop there. They rake the defence in most inappropriate cases because they have nothing to canvass in their favour in the case. The fair hearing provision in the Constitution is the machinery or locomotive of justice, not a spare part to propel or invigorate the case of the user. It is not a casual principle of law available to a Party to be picked up at will in a case and force the Court to apply it to his advantage. On the contrary, it is a formidable and fundamental provision available to a Party, who is really denied lair hearing because he was not heard or that he was not properly heard in the case. Let litigants, who have nothing useful to advocate in favour of the cases, leave the fair hearing constitutional provision alone because it is not available to them just for the asking.  The term, fair hearing, is a recurring decimal in criminal cases because, it is a fundamental right guaranteed to citizens under the Constitution, and a breach of which will nullify the proceedings in favour of a victim, therefore, it is very easy for lawyers and litigants alike to come crying to an appellate Court that their right to fair hearing has been violated.  But \"fair hearing\" is not just an expression of mere rhetoric or empty verbalism; it cannot be construed outside the facts, and a Party alleging the breach must show clearly that the said right is violated or breached - see Gbadamosi v. Dairo 2007 3 NWLR Pt. 1021 282 SC.  In other words, it is not enough for a Party alleging such a breach to merely mention fair hearing, and expect this Court to automatically side with him and determine the case in his favour; just for the asking. The facts of his case must show that the said right was indeed violated. But more often than not, the cry of lack of fair hearing is misleading, as this Court made very clear in Adebayo v. A.-G., Ogun State supra.  In this case, the Appellant's cry is that his right to cross-examine the said PW1, which \"is within the rubric of his right to fair hearing\", was foreclosed by the trial Court, and this denial of fair hearing to him, occasioned miscarriage of justice. As the Appellant put it in his Brief - The rule of audi alteram partem postulates that the trial Judge must hear both sides at every material stage of the proceedings before handing down a decision. The learned trial Judge did not give [him] the opportunity of cross-examining the sole Witness of the Respondent. The denial of fair hearing to [him] in this case is incurably fatal to the Judgment of the trial Court. The Judgment is bound to be set aside. It is irrelevant whether or not the Judgment of the trial Judge made subsequently is correct as the proceedings leading to the Judgment are null and void.  Evidently, the Appellant's allegation is that the trial Court did not give him the opportunity to cross-examine the said PW1. Is that correct? As the Respondent pointed out, he was represented by counsel, and it is not as if PW1 was not available or unwilling to be cross-examined. PW1 was in Court on 31102012, but Appellant's counsel said he had \"a medical problem\", and could not cross-examine PW1 on that day.  The Record also shows that the PW1 was in Court on 3112013, but the Appellant's counsel was not, and that is when the trial Court warned that if Appellant's counsel was not in Court to cross-examine PW1 on the next adjourned date, 632013, PW1 will be discharged. PW1 was in Court on 632013, but the Appellant's counsel was not, and that is when the trial Court granted the Prosecution's application \"to foreclose the right of cross-examination by the [Defence] counsel.\" But in granting the said Application, the trial Court made it clear that: The Court has given more than enough opportunity to the Defendant Counsel sic to cross-examine PW1, the only Witness for the Prosecution, yet the Defendant Counsel sic did not make use of the opportunity.  The word \"opportunity'' means \"a time or set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something\"- see LEXICO powered by OXFORD. Can the Appellant seriously say that he was not given the opportunity to cross-examine PW1, who was always in Court, each time the matter was adjourned to enable the Appellant's counsel cross-examine him? The trial Court granted the adjournments to enable his counsel cross-examine PW1, who also made himself available to be cross-examined, but Appellant's counsel failed to take advantage of the opportunity.  Even so, the Appellant had another opportunity opened to him, when he changed his recalcitrant counsel. On 3042013, another Defence Counsel appeared for the Appellant. She informed the Court that their office had just been briefed, and that she had been trying to get the processes from the former Counsel to continue with the trial. She therefore asked and was granted an adjournment till 1452013. On 1452013, the new Counsel announced her appearance and said, \"the matter is for defence, we are ready to go on\"; and that was that.  There was no mention of re-opening the Prosecution's case, and no application was made to have PW1 recalled for cross-examination. Yes, the Appellant is right that cross-examination of witnesses of the adverse Party, is a constitutional right of a Party to fair hearing, which is guaranteed in Section 361 of the 1999 Constitution as amended, and it is a right that cannot be taken away from Parties in litigation - see Ogolo v. Fubara 2003 11 NWLR Pt. 831237. To this end, it is the duty of the Court to ensure that every Party before it is afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the Witnesses of the adverse Party.  In this case, the Court of Appeal acknowledged these principles; relying upon Simon v. State 2017 LPELR-41988SC, it observed that: It is a constitutional right of a Defendant to be allowed to cross-examine a witness called by the Prosecution. And any breach is a breach of the right of fair hearing and it can have a disastrous effect on the judgment. In the case of Okereke & Anor v. lbe & Ors 2008 LPELR-4714CA the Court held - - - see Fulani v. Rafawa & Ors 2013 LPELR-20384CA. It is fundamental that an opportunity is given for cross-examination because it is the constitutional right of on Accused Person to be given the opportunity to cross-examine Witnesses called by the Prosecution.  But there are exceptions to every rule, and the Court of Appeal added: However, where such an opportunity has been given and the Party fails to cross-examine, then the Courts cannot be blamed … Circumstances where a Party cannot be heard to complain of being denied the right to fair hearing were stated by the Apex Court as follows: \"l said it in the past and will say it again that the duty of the Court, trial and appellate, is to create the atmosphere or environment for a fair hearing of a case, but it is not the duty of the Court to make sure that a Party takes advantage of the atmosphere or environment by involving himself in the fair hearing of the case. A Party, who refuses or fails to take advantage of the fair hearing process, created by the Court, cannot turn around to accuse the Court of denying him fair hearing. This is not fair to the Court, and counsel must not instigate his client to accuse the Court of denying him fair hearing. After all, there is the adage that the best the owner of the horse can do, is to take the horse to the water, he cannot force it to drink the water. The horse has to do that by itself and by the act of sipping. If the horse is unwilling to sip, that ends the matter. The horse will not blame anybody for death arising for lack of water or hydrate sic\". Per Tobi, JSC, in Inakoju & Ors v. Adeleke  2007 LPELR-1510SC  Cross-examination is to test the correctness of the testimony of the Plaintiff and his Witnesses, while re-examination is another chance to clarify facts but not an opportunity to restate the testimony given in evidence in chief all over again. If the basic requirement in attaining fair hearing is to create and give opportunity to Parties, as observed, and a Party fails to use that window, he cannot turn to complain, this was eloquently stated by the erudite jurist, Tobi, JSC in the case of Inakoju.  So, what side of the divide does the Appellant's case fall into? He cited a number of authorities, Iwuoha v. Okoroike supra, Tewogbade v. Agbabiaka supra, and P.H.M.B. v. Edosa supra, to buttress his case that the foreclosure by the trial Court of his right to cross-examine the said PW1, was a violation or breach of his right to fair hearing, and the effect thereof, is that the trial is vitiated, and is rendered null and void. I have scrutinized those cases and I do not see how they help his case.  In Iwuoha v. Okoroike supra, the Appellant filed an Application to amend his Statement of Defence, which Application was dismissed by the trial Court, on a date that the Appellant's counsel was absent, without granting Appellant's Application to enable his counsel appear. The matter came up again, and the Counsel applied to withdraw the Application to amend the Statement of Defence, which was granted. Whereupon, the trial Court called on the Respondent to give evidence, and it refused to allow the said Defence Counsel to cross-examine the Respondent on any point other than that on the issue of damages. The Respondent got Judgment in his favour. The Appellant appealed, and in allowing the Appeal, the Court of Appeal observed as follows: The averring question germane to this Appeal is whether there was a fair hearing in the Court below. A careful perusal of the Record of proceedings including the short judgment of three pages, reveals that although the Appellant was present through out the proceedings, he neither gave nor called evidence, nor did his Counsel address the Court. This, according to the Appellant, was due to the manner in which the learned trial judge conducted the case, which includes making statements prejudicial to the Appellant's case, pontificating on the conduct of the defence thereby muzzling the Defence Counsel from adequately presenting the Appellant's case and also refusing Applications for adjournments at the instance of the Appellant.  In Tewogbade v. Agbabiaka supra, Respondent's counsel objected to his being cross-examined because the Statement of Defence, which had been struck out, is non-existent in law. The Court of Appeal held: It does not matter that the opposite party - - has not filed a Statement of Defence or he does not have one, which is validly before the Court. To deny such a Party, the right to cross-examine is to deny him the right to a fair hearing guaranteed by Section 331 of the [1979 Constitution [i.e. Section 361 of the 1999 Constitution.  In the last case cited by the Appellant, that is PHMB v. Edosa supra, the Respondent, a catering officer in the service of the Appellant, was accused of stealing fresh tomatoes, and two tins of Pronto beverage. 13 Witnesses testified against her at the Disciplinary Committee, and there was no indication that she was allowed to cross-examine them. The trial Court dismissed her action challenging the termination of her appointment with the Appellant. But the Court of Appeal allowed her appeal on the ground that not giving her opportunity to cross-examine the said Witnesses, was a violation of the audi alteram partem rule, and in dismissing the Appellant's Appeal, this Court stated as follows: The allegation of theft is a very serious allegation and before finding a person guilty of such an offence, save where the person accused voluntarily confessed to the allegation, he or she should be given a chance to make a defence and cross-examine witnesses called to prove the allegation, as in this close. In this case, the Respondent was not allowed to cross-examine witnesses, who were heard by the Committee, as the record had shown. This means that the whole proceedings was unfair and unjust and grossly in contravention of the rules of fair hearing contrary to the provisions of Section 33 of the 1979 Constitution.  Quite frankly, I do not see how the factual situations in the three cases, can be helpful to the Appellant, since his case is easily distinguishable.  Yes, the Prosecution called only one Witness, but it is not obliged to call more than one Witness, if it chooses not to -Oduneye v. State 2001 2 NWLR Pt. 697 311 SC. PW1 testified that the Appellant and two other Defendants, were transferred from FESTAC Division at state C.I.D, to Anti Robbery Annex, lkeja, where he was stationed; and that he re-arrested them, and they volunteered their Statements to him.  The trial Court conducted a trial within trial as the Appellant had objected to the admissibility of his own Statement in evidence on the ground that he was tortured to make the said Statement to the Police.  PW1 testified at the trial within trial, and he was cross-examined by the Appellant's counsel. In its Ruling, the trial Court held as follows: PW1 narrated how he cautioned the 2nd Defendant Appellant and the 2nd Defendant appended his signature to the words of caution. There is no evidence before the Court by the 2nd Defendant that he was hung, beating sic before appending his signature to the words of caution. Neither is there any evidence from 2nd Defendant that he was forced to sign twice as indicated in the Statement sought to be tendered by the Prosecution. PW discovered that the Statement of DW1 Appellant was confessional, and took DW1 before a superior Police Officer, Spol Ogunwole ASP, whose endorsement Form is TWT1. The 2nd Defendant endorsed TWT1, and did not complain of beating with cutlass or hung. DW2 and DW3 are not Witnesses of truth as they were not present when the Statement of the 2nd Defendant was taken, but DW3 testified that he saw PW1 hung sic DW1 for 2 days, I do not accept their evidence. DW3's evidence contradicts evidence of the 2nd Defendant that he was hung for 1 12 hours - - - The 2nd Defendant failed to prove torture or that he was forced to give his Statement. I have, therefore, come to the conclusion that the Prosecution has proved that 2nd Defendant's Statement made to PW1 TWT Cpl. Friday Ojiemen was voluntarily made. In the result, the Statement of the 2nd Defendant sought to be tendered, made on 31122006, is hereby admitted as Exhibit P2.  So, PW1 was cross-examined by Appellant's counsel at the trial within trial, but the law says that a trial within trial is a separate and distinct proceeding from the main trial, therefore, evidence adduced therein, \"cannot be transplanted, injected or imported into the main trial\" - see Ifaramoye v. State 2017 LPELR-42031SC. Thus, whatever PW1 said at the trial within trial, in evidence in chief or cross-examination, stays there and cannot be used, in any way or form, in the main trial.  However, the confessional Statement made by the Appellant to the Police, which was admitted in evidence after the trial within trial, is a different matter altogether. It can be said to have crashed through the barrier between those two proceedings, and lawfully transported from the trial within trial to the main trial, where it entrenched itself, as part and parcel of the case for the Prosecution, which is what it is - see Egboghonome v. State 1993 7 NWLR Pt.306 383 SC. In effect, the fact that PW1 was not cross-examined in the main trial, does not destroy the Appellant's Confessional Statement admitted in evidence.  Be that as it may, the Appellant has argued in the alternative that the failure to cross-examine PW1 was a mistake of counsel, therefore, he cannot be held responsible or punished for a mistake of his counsel.  But the truth of the matter is that the Appellant was represented by counsel, two of them in fact. The first counsel, the recalcitrant one, failed, refused or neglected to attend Court to cross-examine PW1, who was always in Court each time, and ready to be cross-examined; opportunities were there but the first counsel chose to waste them.  The second counsel, who had opportunity to correct the wrong, with a simple Application to recall the said PW1 for cross-examination, chose not to do so, and elected to proceed with the defence instead. It may well be that she saw no reason to recall PW1 for that purpose, but that thought belongs in the realm of speculation, and it is settled that neither the Parties nor the Court itself can indulge in speculation - Ikenta Best Ltd. v. Rivers State 20086 NWLR Pt. 1084 612 SC.  Speculation aside, I hold the strong view that the Court of Appeal was absolutely right to affirm the decision of the trial Court since the Appellant was given opportunity to cross-examine PW1 but failed to. The trial Court created the atmosphere for the fair hearing of the case, but he failed to take advantage of the opportunities provided to do so. So, he cannot accuse the trial Court of denying him a fair hearing or find fault with Court of Appeal for affirming the trial Court's decision.  Before I round up, I must comment on the issue of his sentence, which Osayaba Giwa-Osagie, Esq., learned Counsel for the Appellant, considered excessive. He raised the issue at the hearing of the Appeal, but there is no Ground of Appeal challenging his sentence, therefore, there is nothing this Court can do or say on the issue of his sentence.  In the final analysis, this Appeal lacks merit. It, therefore, fails and it is dismissed. The Judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.   OLUKAYODE ARIWOOLA, J.S.C.:  The appellant and others had been arraigned before the trial High Court, Lagos on two count charge of conspiracy to commit robbery and robbery. The facts of the case had been beautifully captured in the lead judgment. The appellant’s complaint is that the trial Court denied him of fair hearing for failure to allow him cross examine the sole witness called by the prosecution, and the affirmation of the decision of the trial Court by the lower Court.  There is no doubt that the appellant deserves to be fairly treated and given fair hearing by the Courts at all stages, inclusive of the apex Court. Hence, a complaint of lack of fair hearing must be carefully looked into by the court. In Michael Udo Vs. The State 1988 LPELR - 3299 SC, this Court opined thus: “The essence and rationale of fair hearing given by the Constitution and Laws of this country to a person standing trial for a capital offence are that in view of the seriousness of the charge in such a case, the trial should not be weighted against an accused person who, not being a legal practitioner does not understand or appreciate the language, procedure, and technicalities of the Court and is therefore in a definite disadvantage if he is made or allowed to conduct his case against a legally qualified person. Anything which detracts from his right to full access to a counsel at any stage of the trial amounts to unfair hearing.”  However, in the instant case, the appellant was given every opportunity to be adequately represented by counsel of his choice and to be fairly heard but his counsel at every stage of the hearing failed to utilize the opportunity. He can therefore not be heard to say that he was not given fair hearing.  Fair hearing does not mean a person must be forcefully heard. Once he is given ample opportunity to be heard, the constitutionally guaranteed principle of fair hearing is fulfilled. The trial Court was therefore right to have proceeded with the hearing of the trial and concluded it the way it did. The Court below was equally right to have affirmed the judgment of the trial Court as there was no evidence of denial of fair hearing.  In the final analysis, I agree that the appeal lacks merit and substance. It deserves to be dismissed. I accordingly dismiss the appeal as my learned brother, Augie, JSC did in the lead judgment. I affirm the judgment of the Court below.  Appeal dismissed.   KUDIRAT MOTONMORI OLATOKUNBO KEKERE-EKUN, J.S.C.:  I have had the benefit of a preview of the judgment of my learned brother, AMINA ADAMU AUGIE, JSC just delivered. I agree with the reasoning and conclusion that the appeal lacks merit and should be dismissed.  The law is quite settled that a complaint of lack of fair hearing will only avail a party where he is able to show that he was denied the opportunity of presenting his case. Whether or not he was denied fair hearing depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. It has been held in several decisions of this Court that the crucial determinant of whether or not a party has been denied fair hearing is whether the parties were afforded an equal opportunity to present their case before judgment is delivered. The Court will take an objective view of the entire proceedings. The true test of fair hearing is the impression of a reasonable man present at the trial and whether from his observation, justice has been done in the case. See: Mohammed Vs Kano Native Authority 1968 1 ALL NLR 424; Akaninwo Vs Nsirim 2008 1 SC Pt. III 151; Otapo Vs Sunmonu 1987 2 NWLR Pt. 58 587 @ 605.  The effect of a breach of the right to fair hearing is that the entire proceedings and any judgment or order made therein become a nullity. See:Audu Vs F.R.N 2013 LPELR - 19897 SC 13; Akinfe Vs The State 1988 3 NWLR Pt. 85 729; Bamgboye Vs University of Ilorin 1999 10 NWLR Pt. 622 290.  Conversely, it has been held severally, that where the Court creates an enabling environment for the parties to ventilate their grievances, either in the prosecution or defence of their case, the failure of a party to take advantage of such conducive environment cannot be the basis for a complaint of lack of fair hearing. See Mfa & Anor Vs. Inongha 2014 1-2 SC Pt. 1 43; Inakoju Vs. Adeleke 2007 LPELR - 1510 SC.  In the instant case, the facts show that the appellant was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings. The respondent's witness, pw1 was in Court and available for cross-examination on several dates to which the case was adjourned. The witness could not be cross-examined owing to the absence of the appellant's counsel. After several adjournments, the prosecution's application to foreclose the right of cross-examination by the defence counsel was granted. The appellant subsequently changed his counsel. At the resumed hearing on 3042013, the new counsel sought an adjournment to enable her study the case file and prepare for the trial. The request was granted. On the adjourned date, 1452013 being fully seised of the matter, the learned counsel did not seek to re-call the PW1 for cross examination. She merely informed the Court that the defence was ready to proceed.  Clearly, from the above scenario, the appellant had every opportunity to cross-examine PW1, but failed to make use of the opportunity. The lower Court as well as the trial Court were right to reject the complaint of denial of fair hearing. It was not made out.  For these and the more detailed reasoning of my learned brother, AMINA ADAMU AUGIE, JSC. I find this appeal to be devoid of merit. It is hereby dismissed. Judgment of the lower Court is affirmed.   PAUL ADAMU GALUMJE, J.S.C.:  I have had the advantage of reading in draft, the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, AMINA ADAMU AUGIE, JSC and I agree that this appeal lacks merit and should be dismissed. Accordingly same is hereby dismissed.   UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI, J.S.C.:  His Lordship, Hon. Justice Amina Augie, JSC, obliged me with a copy of his lead Judgment in this appeal and I find that the reason and conclusion reached therein accord with mine that this appeal is bereft of merit and deserves to be dismissed.  The Appellant and two others were alleged to have used toy gun to attack and rob a motorcycle rider and his passenger, dispossessing them of N500.00 and N1,500 respectively. The Appellant was convicted as charged and sentenced to 21 years imprisonment. On appeal, he also lost, hence this appeal.  The issue left for determination of this appeal is: 1. Whether the Court of Appeal was right in affirming the judgment of the trial Court wherein the trial Court foreclosed the Appellant's right to cross-examine PW1, the Respondent's sole witness.  The PW1 has presented himself to be cross-examined unlike what the Appellant alleges. The horse has been taken to the river for a drink but you can't force it to drink the water. This was pathetically the case of the Appellant. The facts at play show that on 3112012, the Appellant's Counsel could not cross-examine PW1 due to medical problem he had to attend to. Similarly, on 3112013, PW1 was available for cross-examination but the Appellant's Counsel was unavoidably absent. After a caveat from the Court to discharge PW1 and foreclose the Appellant's right to cross-examine the PW1 on the next adjourned date, the Appellant's Counsel was surprisingly absent again on 632013 when PW1 present himself for cross-examination. This is not the case of denial of the right to fair hearing but refusal to avail same or the waiver thereof.  The appellant who, by his own deliberate decision, mis-judgment or inadvertence fails to avail himself of the opportunity of a hearing, cannot later be heard complaining that he was deprived fair hearing. A party cannot and should not complain of breach of his right of fair hearing where he refused to avail himself, as on this instant case, of the opportunity provided under the law to present his case. See Per SANUSI, JSC in DARMA v. ECO BANK 2017 LPELR- 41663SC. It rather goes the other way round that when a party completely refuses or fails to cross examine a witness as in this case, such a party will be deemed to have accepted the testimony of the said witness. See Per OGUNBIYI, J.S.C in ALI v. STATE 2015 LPELR-24711SC.  I therefore align myself with my learned brother that the Appellant's right to cross-examine PW1 was not breached. This appeal therefore is dismissed.-end!" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS The Appellant, as second Defendant, and two other Defendants were arraigned before the Lagos State High Court on a two-Count Charge of conspiracy to commit robbery and robbery. They were alleged to have used a toy gun to attack and rob a motorcycle rider and his passenger, and dispossessed them of the sum of N500 and N1,500 respectively. At the trial, the Prosecution called a sole Witness, Friday Ojiemen, a Policeman attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), lkeja, and he tendered the Statement made by the Appellant to the Police. However, Defence Counsel objected to the admissibility of the said Statement in evidence because \"the Defendant denied writing the Statement, the Defendant alleged duress in obtaining the Statement.\" In the circumstances, the trial Court conducted a trial-within-trial, and after its Ruling of 20/4/2012 wherein the Appellant's confessional Statement was admitted in evidence as Exhibit P2, it adjourned the matter to ''6th, 12th and 13th of June 2012\", for continuation of the trial. After a series of adjournments, mostly at the instance of the Accused, the trial Court, in its Judgment of 1/4/2014, found him guilty as charged, and convicted and sentenced him to 21 years imprisonment.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  In the High Court of Justice, Rivers State, holden at Port Harcourt (Coram) W. A. Chechey, J, this suit consisting of a claim and counterclaim and predicated mainly on the chieftaincy stool known as Okan-Ama of Ibotirem Town in Andoni Local Government Area of Rivers State was instituted. The principal issue in the dispute as between 1st Plaintiff/Respondent and 2nd Defendant/Appellant was the question of who between the two parties was the lawful Okan-Ama (traditional head) of Ibotirem. The case proceeded to hearing. The Respondents as plaintiffs called two witnesses and tendered several Exhibits, numbered Exhibit 1 - 33. As can be gleaned from the printed record, repeated adjournments were sought and granted in favour of the Appellants. Subsequently the Appellants, alleging bias on the part of the trial Judge failed to appear in Court in spite of the issuance and service of hearing notice on them. Pursuant to an application made by the learned counsel for the Plaintiffs/Respondents, both the Appellants’ further cross-examination of the Respondents’ witnesses and the defence of the Appellants was foreclosed by the trial Court, because of Respondents’ absence in Court. On the 2nd day of June, 2004, the learned trial Judge delivered his judgment wherein he held thus:- “But I must say that in all my years, I have hardly ever seen a case more thoroughly and uncompromisingly proved. There was nothing unreasonable in the evidence of the Plaintiffs before me; rather there was much persuasion in them.” Consistent with the above holding of the learned trial Judge, judgment was entered in favour of the Plaintiffs/Respondents and all the five reliefs claimed by them were granted.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  JOHN INYANG OKORO, J.S.C. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  The Respondents as plaintiffs sued the Appellants in Oba Customary Court of Anambra State for a declaration of title to the disputed land and perpetual injunction to restrain the first and second DefendantsAppellants from further trespassing on the land.  The suit was initiated on the 15th of April, 1996. The PlaintiffsRespondents' case in the customary Court was that the land in dispute is in Umuogbu Umuogali village, Oba and originally belonged to their grandfather, Mgbeafulukwe. The land was inherited by their fathers and subsequently by them. Their grandfathers Anaso Mgbeafulukwe and Okafor Mgbeafulukwe gave the land part of which is now in dispute to one Ezeukwu, the father of Sampson Ezeukwu of Umuogbu, Umuogali village, Oba for farming purposes only. Sampson Ezeukwu gave portions of the land to his brothers and also to the father of the 1st defendantappellant for cultivation. When the father of the 1st defendantappellant died, the 1st defendantappellant continued to cultivate the land.  Sometime in 1994, the Appellant erected survey pillars on the land claiming that the 2nd appellant, Okeke Icheke from Aboji village, Oba, had sold the land to him. That in spite of customary arbitration and other efforts to get the 1st Appellant out of the land, the 1st Appellant persisted in laying claim over the land. The Respondents as plaintiffs thereafter instituted this action in the Customary Court, Oba.  The 1st defendantappellant on the other hand claimed that the land in dispute was given to their father Odili by Onuora Nwangwu and Icheke Nwangwu to cultivate on payment of tribute. He cultivated the land until their elder Ezeukwu called him and told him that the land was for sale. He bought the land from the 2nd and 3rd defendantsAppellants and an agreement was prepared. The agreement was admitted in evidence as Exhibit \"M\". The 1st defendant also applied for and was issued a Customary Certificate of Occupancy tendered in evidence as Exhibit \"L\".  At the conclusion of trial, the Customary Court delivered its Judgment in favour of the plaintiffs and granted the reliefs sought.  The defendantsappellants being dissatisfied with the decision of the Customary Court appealed to the High Court. The High Court affirmed the judgment of the Customary Court and the defendantsappellants further appealed to the Court below. After hearing the said appeal, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.  This appeal is therefore against the judgment of the Court below delivered on 19th June, 2006. Notice of appeal was filed on 20th April, 2010 presumably by the order of the Court of appeal.  At the hearing of this appeal on 30th April, 2019, learned counsel for the Appellants, J. R. Nduka, Esq. adopted the brief of the Appellants settled by him and filed on 29th October, 2012. In the said brief, two issues are distilled for the determination of this appeal as follows: 1.Whether the principle that ownership of land can be proved by proof of possession of connected or adjacent land in circumstances rendering it probable that the owner of such connected or adjacent land would in addition be the owner of the land in dispute applies to this case. 2. Whether the age-long rule in Kodilinye v. Odu 1935 2 WACA 336 requiring that the plaintiff must succeed on the strength of his own case is applicable to this case.  The brief of the Respondents was settled by Emeka Anyaenetu, Esq. and filed on 29th January, 2013. In it, the Respondents have formulated similar issues as the appellant but couched differently thus: 1. Whether on the facts of this case, the Court of Appeal was right when it upheld the decision of the High Court that the Respondents proved tilted to the land in dispute by \"Proof of possession of connected or adjacent land in circumstances rendering it probable that the owner of such connected or adjacent land would in addition be the owner of the land in dispute\". 2. Whether the principle in the case of Kodilinye v. Odu 1935 2 WACA 336 requiring that the plaintiff must succeed on the strength of his own case is applicable to his own case is applicable to this case and whether the weakness in the Appellants' case do not support the plaintiffsRespondents' case.  I shall determine this appeal based on the two similar issues donated by both parties.  ISSUE ONE: Under this issue, the learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the rule that ownership of land can be proved \"by proof of possession of connected or adjacent land in circumstances rendering it probable that the owner of such connected or adjacent land would in addition be the owner of the land in dispute\" applies to all Courts under the doctrine of Stare Decisis and that the above principle applies to this case is not disputed. According to him, what is however disputed is that on the facts of this case, the principle ought not to apply.  He contended that by the plaintiffs' survey plan tendered at the trial, it shows that both the appellants and the 2nd and 3rd Respondents have land adjoining the land in dispute. In the circumstance, he asked if the principle can apply where the two disputants' to a land in dispute also have land adjoining the said disputed land. He submitted that the principle, in the circumstance, cannot apply. He urged the Court to resolve this issue in favour of the appellants.  In response, the learned counsel for the Respondents submitted that the Court below was right to uphold the decision of the appellate High Court which held that the principle of ownership of adjacent land applies in this case. He opined that the Court below was not only right in its statement of the law but also appreciated the complaint of the appellant on the issue before it. That on the fact of this case, the principle applied perfectly, relying on the case of Onwugbufor v. Okoye  1996 1 SCNJ 1 at p. 4 ratio 4.  Learned Counsel contended that in Exhibit 'M' Deed of Transfer of Customary Right of Occupancy tendered by the defendants and by which the 2nd and 3rd defendants transferred the land in dispute to the 1st defendant, the land is described as situate at Umuagu Umuagali Village Oba. That no explanation was given as to how the 2nd and 3rd defendants both of whom are from Aboji village Oba came to own land in Umuagali Oba another village- whether by conquest, inheritance, purchase, gift or otherwise. According to him, this is a pointer to the fact that the 2nd and 3rd defendantsAppellants cannot own the land in dispute.  Learned counsel submitted that the Court below was right when it held that both the customary Court and the High Court made concurrent findings on the issue.  It is his contention that the argument of the appellant that their land adjoin the land in dispute on one side falls flat in the face of the fact that the land in dispute, by their own documentary evidence Exhibit 'M' in the customary Court is in another village Umuogali Village Oba which is the plaintiffRespondents' village while they, the 2nd and 3rd Appellants are from Aboji Village Oba. He urged this Court to hold that the principle applies to the facts of this case. He urged the Court also to resolve this issue against the appellant.  The law is trite that title to land can be proved by the following five grounds:- 1. Proof by traditional history or traditional evidence. 2. Proof by grant or the production of document of title. 3. Proof by acts of ownership extending over a sufficient length of time numerous and positive enough to warrant the inference that the persons exercising such acts are true owners of the land. 4. Proof by acts of long Possession. 5. Proof by possession of connected or adjacent land in circumstances rendering it probable that the owner of such land would in addition be the owner of the land in dispute. See Idundun & Ors v. Okumagba 1976 10 SC 277, lseogbekun & Anor v. Adelakun & Ors 2013 2 NWLR Pt 1337 140, Madu v. Madu 2008 6 NWLR Pt 1083 296, Odunze & Ors v. Nwosu & Ors 2007 13 NWLR Pt 1050 1, Duru v. Nwosu 1989 4 NWLR Pt 113 24. A plaintiff seeking declaration of title to land does not need to plead and prove all the five methods stated above. He only needs to prove one of such method. lf he pleads andor relies on more than one method to prove his title, he merely does so ex abundante cautela as proof of one simple root of title is sufficient to sustain a plaintiff's claim for declaration of title to land. See Onwugbufor v. Okoye 1996 1 SCNJ 1.  On this, the Court of first instance i.e. the Customary Court of Oba made the following findingsdecision on page 116 line 5 - 11 of the record of appeal thus: \"Both 1st defendant and 3rd defendant failed to lead a convincing evidence how the land of Aboji people is situate at Umuagu Umuogali Village, Oba, whether through conquest, purchase, gift or in exchange, convincing evidence ought to be led to marry the assertion of owning a land in a different village, history ought to be led to establish such a right.\"  At the High Court sitting as an appellate Court, the learned appellate Judge made the following profound findings on page 230 of the record, to wit:  \"I am of the view and I agree with counsel for the Respondents that the Respondent's established their title to the land in dispute through this 5th method, that is by proof of possession of connected or adjacent land in circumstances rendering it probable that they also own the land in dispute. In survey plan No TLSAN115395 attached to Exhibits 'M' and 'L' tendered in evidence by the defendants, the land immediately adjacent to the land in dispute on the far right was clearly marked as belonging to the Anazo Anolue family - the plaintiffs family. On the opposite side of the survey plan, at the tail end of the left side of the land in dispute, you have the compound of Anthony Ezeukwu... PW7 Anthony Ezeukwu’s wife testified that the plaintiffs’ grandfather gave to them the land at the back of their compound where they dug their pit toilet. That was indeed the only issue she gave evidence about. The defendants who cross-examined her at length did not put even a single question in cross examination relating to the main issue of her examination -in- chief. Furthermore, in exhibit 'M', Deed of Transfer of Customary Right of Occupancy by which the 2nd and 3rd defendants transferred the land in dispute to the 1st defendant, the land was described as situate at Umuagu, Umuogali Village Oba. No explanation was given as to how the vendors Okeke lcheke - 2nd defendant and Eleazer Onuora - 3rd defendant, both of Aboji village, Oba could own land at Umuagu, Umuogali village, Oba. It is my view therefore, that proof of possession of adjacent land to the land in dispute with the bulk of the disputed land in between, coupled with evidence that the land in dispute is in Umuogali Village render it probable that the plaintiffs are the owners of the disputed land.\"  Based on the above findings of the customary Court and the High Court, the Court below agreed with them in the following words recorded on page 296 of the record of appeal: \"Both the Customary Court Oba and the High Court of Anambra State sitting in Ogidi have made concurrent findings of fact in favour of the respondents that they own the land. It is not for this Court to interfere with such findings of fact unless they are shown to be perverse and that is not the case here. See Aigbobahi v. Aifuwa 2006 6 NWLR Pt 976 270. I have read the record of appeal and there is abundant evidence to justify the conclusion of the High Court that the respondent were entitled to judgment.\"  I have no difficulty in agreeing with the three Courts below that the respondents proved the title to the disputed land by possession of connected or adjacent land in circumstances rendering it probable that the owner of such connected or adjacent land would in addition be the owner of the land in dispute. Now, come to think of it. The appellants’ great grand fathers were given the land for cultivation only and the land devolved on the 1st defendantappellant. Suddenly, a total stranger from another village 2nd and 3rd appellants appeared, claimed ownership of the land and sold it to the 1st appellant. I think the 1st appellant and members of his family were not wise enough. They ought to have referred the matter to the Respondents andor question the root of title of the 2nd and 3rd Appellants. Failure to do so is fatal to his case.  Secondly, the 2nd and 3rd appellants failed woefully to prove to the Court how they came about the disputed land. They are from Aboji Village while the land situates at Umuagali village. As observed by the trial customary Court, did they acquire the land through conquest, purchase, gift or in exchange for another land? They ought to have led evidence to show how they owned the land in the Respondents' village. This they failed to do. The three Courts below have found that the Respondents own other lands adjacent to the land in dispute and this has not been challenged. The law is trite that unchallenged evidence, if believed, ought to be acted upon. See Okike v. Legal Practitioner Disciplinary Committee 2005 15 NWLR Pt 949 471, Kayili v. Yilbuk & Ors 2015 LPELR - 24923 SC.  The appellants, i.e. 2nd and 3rd, having failed to prove how they came by any land in the Respondents' village, this does not negate the application of this principle to this case. Accordingly, I resolve this issue against the appellants.  ISSUE 2: In this issue, the learned counsel for the appellants made a summary of the evidence of the plaintiffsRespondents at the trial Court, analyzed and criticized same and came to the conclusion that \"it will be tantamount to grave injustice to allow the principle of concurrent findings of fact to deprive the appellate Court of the right to look at these contradictory claims over the same land and find that the plaintiff must succeed on the strength of his own case is applicable in this case.\" That is all.  Conversely, the learned counsel for the Respondents also reviewed the evidence and submitted that the principle in Kodilinye v. Odu 1935 2 WACA 336 requiring that the plaintiff must succeed on the strength of his own case applies in this case and that the weaknesses and inconsistencies in the defendants' case naturally strengthened the plaintiffs' case. He urged the Court to resolve this issue against the appellant.  Since the decision of Webber, C.J. in Kodilinye v. Odu 1935 2 WACA 366 and a plethora of subsequent decisions by this Court, it is now trite that in an action for declaration of title to land, the onus is on the plaintiff to satisfy the Court that he is entitled on the evidence adduced by him to a declaration by the Court. The law is very clear that he must rely and succeed on the strength of his own case and not on the weakness of the case of the defendant. Again if the plaintiff fails to discharge the onus of proof of his case, the weakness of the defendant's case will not support the case of plaintiff. See Efetiroroje & Ors v. Okpalefe II & Ors 1991 5 NWLR Pt 193 517, Elufisoye v. Alabetutu 1963 NMLR 298, Oladimeji v. Oshode 1968 1 AU NLR 417.  The law is also settled that where however, the evidence of the defendant tends to establish the title of the plaintiff and supports his case, the plaintiff is entitled to take advantage of such evidence to establish his title. See Piaro v. Tenalo 1976 12 SC 31, Egonu v. Egonu 1978 1112 SC.111, Nkanu v. Onun 1977 5 SC 13, Idundun v. Okumagba 1976 910 SC 227, Momoh & Ors v. Umoru & Ors 2011 15 NWLR Pt 1270 217, Civil Design Construction Nig Ltd v. SCOA Nig. Ltd. 2007 6 NWLR Pt 1324 538 Oyinloye v. Esinkin & Ors 1999 5 SCNJ 278.  In the instant case, the three Courts below agree that the plaintiffRespondents not only proved their case with credible evidence, but also that the Respondents took advantage of the appellants' case which supports their title to the land in dispute.  The record of appeal shows that at the trial, the plaintiffs called witnesses who testified in their favour. Apart from witnesses, they tendered documents. In Exhibit B, survey plan tendered by the plaintiffsRespondents and in their evidence the plaintiffs stated that they own the land in dispute at one end in which land they plant cocoyam and cassava which land is not in dispute. At the opposite end of the survey plan to the west, the plaintiffs state that their fathers granted the land to Anthony Ezeukwu on which he built his house. PW7, Mrs. Elizabeth Ezeukwu, senior wife of Anthony Ezeukwu, testified that the plaintiff's father gave them the land behind their house on which they built their pit latrine. It is on record that this piece of evidence was never challenged or controverted by the defendants either during cross examination or during their evidence in chief.  By the above evidence of the plaintiffsRespondents, they have shown that they own parcels of land adjoining or adjacent to the disputed land. Therefore, when both oral and documentary evidence by the Respondents are put together, it is clear they have proved their case to the satisfaction of the Court. In other words, they can succeed clearly on the strength of their case as espoused in Kodilinye v. Odu supra.  That notwithstanding, the defendants by their own evidence also supported the case of the Respondents. In their Exhibit 'M' - Deed of customary Grant of land made in 1993 before the dispute arose, state that the land in dispute is in Ummogali, Oba while the vendors i.e. 2nd and 3rd Appellants, are from Aboji Village. The survey plan also showed land belonging to the respondents bordering the land in dispute.  By the Appellants' evidence, there is no nexus between the vendors from Aboji village and the land in dispute situate in the Respondents' viilage Umuogari. As the judges of the trial customary Court observed, both the 2nd and 3rd appellants as defendants failed to lead convincing evidence how the land of Aboiyi people came to be situate at Umuagu Umuagali Oba, whether through conquest, purchase, gift, or in exchange. That convincing evidence ought to be led to marry the assertion of owning a land in a different village and that history ought to be led to establish such a right.  From the totality of evidence led by both parties, it is obvious that though the plaintiffsRespondents could succeed on the strength of their own case alone, the weakness in the defendantsappellants' case has strengthen the Respondents' case and this has been the position of the three lower Courts. I agree that the plaintiffsRespondents succeeded clearly on the strength of their case. The case of the defendantsAppellants clearly supported the case of the PlaintiffsRespondents, I resolve this issue against the appellants.  Having resolved the two issues against the appellants, I am satisfied that this appeal is devoid of any scintilla of merits. It deserves an order of dismissal. Appeal is accordingly dismissed. I affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on 19th June, 2006. I award costs of N200,000 to the PlaintiffsRespondents to be paid by all the Appellants.   IBRAHIM TANKO MUHAMMAD, AG. C.J.N.:  I have the advantage of reading before now the Judgment of my learned brother Okoro, JSC. For the reasons set out in the lead Judgment, I have nothing to add to my Lord's reasoning and conclusion. There is no merit in the appeal and it ought to be dismissed. I too, hereby dismiss the appeal.   OLUKAYODE ARIWOOLA, J.S.C.:  I had the opportunity of reading in draft the lead judgment of my learned brother, Okoro, JSC just delivered. I agree entirely with the reasoning and conclusion that the appeal is unmeritorious and should be dismissed. I too will dismiss the appeal.  Appeal dismissed.  I abide by the consequential order in the leading judgment including the order on costs.   PAUL ADAMU GALUMJE, J.S.C.:  I have had the privilege of reading in draft, the judgment just delivered by my Learned brother, John Inyang Okoro JSC and I agree with the reasoning contained therein and the conclusion arrived thereat. The 1st issue for determination of this appeal, as set out in the lead judgment is just one of the five ways of proving title to land. The issue of possession of adjacent land is subordinate to solid evidence of traditional title. Once a party has laid solid and unbroken chain of traditional history of how he acquired the land, evidence of possessing adjacent land is clearly displaced.  The appeal herein attacks the concurrent findings of facts by three Courts. The Appellant has not shown any exceptional reason why this Court should interfere with those findings. For these few words and the more elaborate reasoning in the lead judgment, this appeal shall be, and it is hereby dismissed.  I abide by the consequential orders made in the lead judgment, including order as to costs.   UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI, J.S.C.:  I had a preview of the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, John Inyang Okoro, JSC and I agree with his reasoning and conclusion arrived thereat.  This appeal is a fall out of the decision of the lower Court which dismissed the suit of the Appellants. The Respondents initiated the suit in 1996 at the Customary Court of Anambra State for a declaration of title to the disputed land and perpetual injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd Appellants from further trespass to the land. The facts are as contained in the lead judgment. The Court of 1st instance, the Customary Court, considered the facts of the case and gave judgment against the Appellants. On appeal to the High Court, the case was dismissed for lacking in merit. At the lower Court, same was dismissed. My learned brother, John Inyang Okoro, JSC, considered same and has dismissed the case of the Appellants.  The issues for determination formulated by the Appellants, learned Counsel are: 1. Whether the principle that ownership of land can be proved by proof of possession of connected or adjacent land in circumstances rendering it probable that the owner of such connected or adjacent land would in addition be the owner of the land in dispute applies to this case. 2. Whether the age-long rule in Kodilinye v. Odu 1935 2 WACA 336 requiring that the Plaintiff must succeed on the strength of his own case is applicable to this case. The Appellants' great grand fathers were given the land for cultivation only and the land subsequently devolved on the 1st Appellant. All of a sudden, a total stranger from another village the 2nd and 3rd Appellants claimed ownership of the land and sold it to the 1st Appellant. The proof of ownership of the disputed land must be done either 1 By traditional evidence 2 By document of title 3 By various acts of ownership and possession numerous and positive to warrant inference of ownership 4 By acts of long possession and enjoyment of land 5 By proof of possession of adjacent land in dispute in such circumstances which render it probable that the owner of the adjacent land is the owner of the land in dispute. See IDUNDUN v. OKUMAGBA 1976 9-10 SC 227, OGUNNAIKE v. OJAYEMI 1987 1 NWLR PT. 53 760.  It is now well established principle of law that a party claiming declaration of title to a statutory or customary right of occupancy to land does not need to plead more than one of the prescribed methods of proof of title to land to succeed. See Per ADEREMI, J.S.C in YUSUF v. ADEGOKE & ANOR 2007 LPELR-3534 SC.  In the instant appeal, the Respondents' claim and proof of the title to the land in dispute is predicated on their proof of possession of adjacent land in dispute. This was abundantly proved against that of the Appellants that made strange and unproved claims unknown in law.  It has long been settled that proof of title to land where the root of title is traced to ancestors, are entirely questions of fact to be established by evidence. Where there are specific findings of fact in the Court of trial in respect of such issues, a Court on appeal will be most reluctant and indeed seldom will interfere with such findings. See Per KARIBI-WHYTE, JSC in AJAO & ORS v. ALAO & ORS 1986 LPELR-285 SC.  It is true that one of these five methods or ways of proof of title is by proof of possession of connected and adjacent land in circumstances rendering it probable that the owner of such connected and adjacent land would also be the owner of the land in dispute. See Per OPUTA, JSC in DURU & ANOR v. NWOSU  1989 LPELR- 968 SC.  The Appellants woefully failed to prove another method of proving title to the land in dispute, making their case so weak and improbable. It is settled and well established that declaratory reliefs are not granted even on admission. The plaintiff who sought for such relief must prove and succeed on the strength of his case and not rely on the weakness of the defence. The burden of proof on the plaintiff in establishing declaratory relief to the satisfaction of the Court is quite heavy in the sense that such declaratory reliefs are not granted even on admission by the defendant where the plaintiff fails to establish his entitlement to the declaration by his own evidence. The Court does not make declarations of right either on admission or in default of defence without having evidence and being satisfied by such evidence to the plaintiffs entitlement to such a right, See Per OGUNBIYI, JSC in MOHAMMED v. WAMMAKO & ORS 2017 LPELR- 42667 SC.  The stance of the 3 lower Courts and that of my learned brother on the facts and principles established in this case must not be tampered with and remains sacrosanct. I abide fully with their decisions that this appeal grossly lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. The costs awarded are agreeable by me.-end! " ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The Respondents as plaintiffs sued the Appellants in Oba Customary Court of Anambra State for a declaration of title to the disputed land and perpetual injunction to restrain the first and second Defendants/Appellants from further trespassing on the land. The Plaintiffs/Respondents' case in the customary Court was that the land in dispute is in Umuogbu Umuogali village, Oba and originally belonged to their grandfather, Mgbeafulukwe. The land was inherited by their fathers and subsequently by them. Their grandfathers Anaso Mgbeafulukwe and Okafor Mgbeafulukwe gave the land part of which is now in dispute to one Ezeukwu, the father of Sampson Ezeukwu of Umuogbu, Umuogali village, Oba for farming purposes only. Sampson Ezeukwu gave portions of the land to his brothers and also to the father of the 1st defendant/appellant for cultivation. When the father of the 1st defendant/appellant died, the 1st defendant/appellant continued to cultivate the land. Sometime in 1994, the Appellant erected survey pillars on the land claiming that the 2nd appellant, Okeke Icheke from Aboji village, Oba, had sold the land to him. That in spite of customary arbitration and other efforts to get the 1st Appellant out of the land, the 1st Appellant persisted in laying claim over the land. The Respondents (as plaintiffs) thereafter instituted this action in the Customary Court, Oba. The 1st defendant/appellant on the other hand claimed that the land in dispute was given to their father Odili by Onuora Nwangwu and Icheke Nwangwu to cultivate on payment of tribute. He cultivated the land until their elder Ezeukwu called him and told him that the land was for sale. He bought the land from the 2nd and 3rd defendants/Appellants and an agreement was prepared. The agreement was admitted in evidence as Exhibit \"M\". The 1st defendant also applied for and was issued a Customary Certificate of Occupancy tendered in evidence as Exhibit \"L\". At the conclusion of trial, the Customary Court delivered its Judgment in favour of the plaintiffs and granted the reliefs sought. The High Court affirmed the judgment of the Customary Court and the defendants/appellants further appealed to the Court of Appeal which also affirmed the trial court’s decision.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  AYOBODE OLUJIMI LOKULO-SODIPE, J.C.A.: Delivering the Leading Judgment:  The appeal is against the judgment delivered on 2062005, by the High Court of Justice, Owerri Judicial Division, presided over by Hon. Justice A.O.H. Ukachukwu hereafter to be simply referred to as “the Lower Court” and “learned trial Judge” respectively.  The Appellant was the 3rd accused person in Charge No. HOWART2199. In the said charge, the Appellant and 3 others were charged with the offence of armed robbery contrary to Section 12a of the Robbery and Firearms Special Provisions Act, Cap. 398, Laws of Federation of Nigeria, 1990 hereafter to be simply referred to as “Cap. 398”. In the particulars of offence, the Appellant and the 3 other accused persons and other still at large; while armed with firearms were alleged to have robbed one John Nwokeocha and his passengers of one Mercedes Benz 911 Lorry with Registration No. AE 281 and money totaling N260,715.00, on 1731998 at Mgbee along OrluUrualla-Akaokwa Road in Orlu Judicial Division. The charge was read over to the accused persons including the Appellant on 1081999, and each of them pleaded not guilty thereto. The prosecution called 6 witnesses in the proof of its case against the Appellant and the other accused persons. The Appellant and each of the other accused persons, testified in their own behalf, and called no other witness. In its judgment, the Lower Court noted that the 1st accused person in the charge before it, namely John Okorie confessed to the crime and that the other accused persons Appellant inclusive in their evidence denied the charge. The judgment of the Lower Court spans pages 243-283 of the records of appeal. Therein, after an extensive review of the evidence placed before it, and evaluation of the oral evidence adduced by the prosecution and the accused persons as well as the statements made to the Police by the Appellant and other accused persons respectively, the Lower Court in the judgment appealed against, found the prosecution to have proved its case against the Appellant and 2 of the other accused persons beyond reasonable doubt. The said Court did not find the prosecution to have done this, in respect of the 4th accused person. Hence, the lower Court convicted the Appellant and 2 of the other accused persons of the offence preferred against them; and duly sentenced each of the Appellant and 2 of the other accused persons to death as mandated by the law under which they were charged. The 4th accused person in the charge having been found not guilty, was acquitted and discharged.  Dwelling specifically on the case of the prosecution as it relates to the Appellant on pages 275-281 of the records of appeal, the Lower Court stated: - “Finally the 3rd accused denied any involvement in the robbery. As in the case of the 1st and 2nd accused he did not call any witness, not any of who travelled with him to the market. For his address his counsel formulated two issues for determination by this Court. These are: Firstly - whether he was one of those who took part in the robbery and whether the defence of alibi does not avail him. Secondly - whether the extra judicial statement of the 3rd accused i.e. Exhibits G,L,M and N qualify as confessional statement. Since either of the issues determines the guilt or otherwise of the 3rd accused, I shall consider them together. Before that, let me state that the statements of the 3rd accused i.e. D.W.3 made on 17398, 20398, 24398 and 7598 were admitted in evidence as Exhibits G, L, M and N followed the ruling of this Court on 15th October, 1999 in a trial within trial by which the objection of counsel to the admission of the statement made 17th March, 1998 was over ruled. I am bound by that ruling. As part of his defence of alibi, the D.W.3 told this Court that he traveled to Lafia market in the morning of 17th March, 1998 and returned to Orlu between the hours of 11am and 12:00 noon of the same day. Apart from the fact that he could not call or mention as his witness any of the traders in whose company he traveled, I consider it impossible of a vehicle - a transport Mercedes 911 Lorry to travel to Lafia from Orlu and return within the time stated considering the state of the roads movement of the vehicle and time in the market by all traders. In his evidence, he mentioned the conductor of the vehicle in which he allegedly travelled and as against calling him as a witness he rather gave the Court the impression that the said conductor and his brothers gave him out to the Police Warden who arrested and took him to the Police Station Orlu where their older brother and owner of the Lorry-Dennis was sic already posted and discussing with the Police. The question might be asked why the plan to involve him? That calls up the issue of his arrest. As against the evidence of the P.W.4 Nicholas Okonkwo that he arrested him, and that of the Police that he was arrested by the villagers the 3rd accused D.W.3 insisted that he was arrested by the police traffic warden. The question may again be asked - what does the police or traffic warden lose by accepting that they arrested the 3rd accused even if outside sic: scene of the crime and further what does the P.W.4 gain by claiming a feat performed by the police after he earned the credit of arresting the 1st accused. Iroabuchi Okereke testified in this case as the P.W.3. He testified as to his escape into the bush and later return to watch the robbers as well as the operation loss of his N62,000.00 Sixty two Thousand Naira to the robber. He did not mention the D.W.3 or claim any part he played in his arrest. The question might again be asked what does he lose by openly assisting the police to effect his arrest if he saw him at the scene andor was certain he was one of those that robbed them. The D.W.3 testified that he was yet to off load his goods from the lorry before he left to see the captured robbers. Since he had nobody in mind as likely to have been arrested one would ask to know why the hurry to behold the robbers even at the risk of abandoning his goods in the vehicle. If the story of the D.W.3 is believed my view is that it emanated from an agitated mind. But I do not believe the story. I rather believe the account of the arrest of the 3rd accused D.W.3 as given by the P.W.4 Nicholas Okonkwo. My answer to the 2nd issues therefore is that the extra judicial statements of the D.W.3 i.e. Exhibits G,L,M and N qualified as confessional statements. I also hold as part of issue number one that the defence of alibi did not avail him. I accept the evidence of the P.W.4 as the true account of the arrest of the D.W.3 i.e. 3rd accused. I also hold that the statements of the D.W.3 Exhibits G,L,M and N corroborated in material details the statements of Joseph Anoke made 17th and 15th March, 1998 - Exhibits E and J respectively. I do not accept the 1st accused attempt to exclude him from participation in the robbery ....”  Suffice it to say, that having also considered the case of the 4th accused person, the Lower Court concluded its judgment thus: - “In the result, I find the 1st accused John Okorie, 2nd accused Samuel Akpa and 3rd accused Michael Ori guilty of armed robbery contrary to Section 12a of the Robbery and Firearms Special Provision Act 1990 as charged. I find the 4th accused Onu Njoku not guilty. He is acquitted and discharged.”  Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the Lower Court convicting him of the offence of armed robbery and sentencing him to death therefor, the Appellant initiated the instant appeal by lodging at the registry of the said Court, a notice of appeal dated 1942013 and filed on the same date, pursuant to the leave of this Court, granted on 1142013, extending the time within which the Appellant, was to appeal.  The notice of appeal contains 4 grounds of appeal. The grounds therein, shorn of their respective particulars read:- “GROUNDS OF APPEAL GROUND 1 ERROR IN LAW The trial High Court erred in law when it convicted the appellant despite the exculpatory evidence made in favour of the appellant by DW1 i.e. 1st accused person, John Okorie. GROUND 2 ERROR IN LAW The trial Court erred in law when it admitted and placed reliance on the statement of Joseph Anoke the trapped armed robbery suspect i.e. Exhibit E in convicting the appellant. GROUND 3 ERROR IN LAW The High Court of Imo State erred in law when it held that the defence of alibi did not avail the appellant i.e. Michael Ori. GROUND 4 The verdict is unreasonable unwarranted and unsupportable having regard to the evidence led at the trial.”  The reliefs which the Appellant seeks from this Court as contained in the notice of appeal are:  i an order allowing the appeal and setting aside the conviction and sentence of the Appellant as per the judgment of the Lower Court delivered on 2062005;and  ii an order discharging and acquitting the Appellant.  The appeal was entertained on 2712020, with learned counsel, P.C. Onuoha adopting the amended Appellant’s brief of argument dated 21122015, and filed on 2092019, but deemed as properly filed on 2392019, in urging the Court to allow the same.  Though the Respondent was served with the amended brief of argument of the Appellant on 2092019, and hearing notice in respect of the date fixed for the appeal i.e. 2712020 on 9122019, the Respondent was not represented by counsel in Court at the hearing of the appeal on 2712020. However, as the Respondent had earlier filed a brief of argument in the appeal, it was deemed as having been duly argued by the Respondent on the said brief. The Respondent’s brief of argument in question is dated 1222018, and filed on 2022018, but deemed to have been properly filed and served on 2222018.  In his amended brief of argument, the Appellant distilled for the determination of the appeal, the following issues: - “1Whether the trial Judge was right in relying on Exhibits \"E”, and “J\" in convicting the appellant despite the exculpatory evidence given in favour of the appellant by the 1st accused person, John Okore. 2 Whether the appellant was a party to the offence and whether the defence of alibi does not avail him. 3 Whether the extra-judicial statements of the appellant i.e. Exhibits \"G”, “L”, “M” and “N\" qualify as confessional statements and whether the trial Court was right in relying on same to convict the appellant.”  The issues which the Respondent formulated for the determination of the appeal, in its brief of argument are: - “i. Whether the prosecution by admissible evidence proved the offence of armed robbery against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt? ii. Whether the defence of alibi as raised by the Appellant during his address in Court can be available in law for the benefit of the Appellant?”  The issues formulated by the Respondent are broad enough to accommodate those formulated by the Appellant. Accordingly, the appeal will be resolved on the issues formulated by the Respondent even though the issues formulated by the Appellant will be considered under the two issues formulated by the Respondent, as considered appropriate.  APPELLANT’S ISSUES 1 AND 3: The Appellant argued his issues 1 and 3, together. These two issues in my considered view simply raise the question as to whether the Lower Court acted on admissible evidence in convicting the Appellant. The issues therefore will be considered together with issue 1, as formulated by the Respondent.  Dwelling on these issues, the Appellant submitted that it was wrong for the Lower Court to have relied on Exhibits \"E” and “J”, as well as Exhibits “G, L, M and N\", in convicting him. The portion of the judgment of the Lower Court the Appellant relied upon in this regard reads: - \"I also hold that the statements of DW3, i.e.Exhibits \"G, L, M and N\" corroborated in material details the statements of Joseph Anoke made on 17398 - i.e. Exhibits \"E and J\" respectively.\"  It is the stance of the Appellant that firstly, Exhibits \"E and J\" are confessional statements of Joseph Anoke wherein he admitted the offence and implicated him Appellant; while Exhibits \"G, L, M, and N\" are his 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th statements. The Appellant submitted that it is trite that where an accused person makes a confessional statement implicating a co-accused, the confession is only evidence against the accused person that made it and not evidence against his co-accused unless such co-accused adopts the confessional statement in question by word or conduct. That if an accused person however goes into the witness box and testifies on oath and repeats what he told the police in his statement, then his sworn evidence becomes evidence in the case for all purposes, even if it is against his co-accused. That in the instant case, the maker of Exhibits “E” and “J” never testified in Court as he died before the commencement of trial. It is the stance of the Appellant that it was therefore an error in law for the Lower Court to have convicted him on the statement of another accused person to the Police. That this is more so as the maker of Exhibits \"E & J\", was not subjected to cross-examination to test the veracity of his statements. The Appellant submitted that in the circumstances, Exhibits \"G, L, M and N, which are his statements cannot be corroborated by Exhibits \"E and J\", sic as was wrongly held by the Lower Court. This Court was urged to expunge Exhibits \"E and J\" because S. 294 of the Evidence Act, forbids the use of such statements.  Also, the Appellant having re-produced the holding of the Lower Court that: - “I do not accept the 1st accused attempt to exclude him the appellant from participating in the robbery\" submitted that the position of the Lower Court in this regard was wrong. It is the stance of the Appellant that there was sufficient evidence exculpating him from participation in the robbery. This is because i the 1st accused John Okore who confessed to the offence in Exhibits \"F and K\", told the lower Court during the trial within trial conducted in the case that Michael Ori the Appellant was not a member of their gang and ii also reiterated his position in this respect during the substantive trial while testifying as DW1. That DW1 admitted committing the offence with which he was charged and still told the lower Court that nobody in their gang was known as and called Michael Ori i.e. Appellant. Furthermore, that both John Okore 1st accused and Okechukwu Ori who died before the trial, stated that the Appellant was not a member of their gang. That in Exhibit \"G\" i.e. Appellant’s 1st statement he told the police timeously that he traveled to Lafia in Nasarawa State on the date of the offence i.e. 17398, and was not a party to the robbery.  That aside from this, it was mandatory for the Lower Court to have made a specific finding as to whether a confessional statement was actually made by an accused person before holding that the statement was retracted or before putting them into any use in convicting him Appellant. This is because, he Appellant raised the plea on non est factum as he denied ever making Exhibits \"L, M and N\" and maintained that they were written by the Police and brought to him to sign at gun-point. That the Lower Court in the circumstances was under a duty to have made a specific finding as to whether he Appellant actually made the confessional statements ascribed to him before holding that the said statements were retracted or before putting them into any use in convicting him Appellant. It is the stance of the Appellant that the Lower Court did not do this in respect of Exhibits \"L, M, and N\" before using them in convicting him.  This Court was urged by the Appellant to resolve his issues 1 and 3 in his favour.  Dwelling on these issues which in my considered view are subsumed in its issue 1, the Respondent having stated and set out the elements of the offence of armed robbery, submitted that the prosecution proved its case against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt. That it did this by the evidence accepted by the Lower Court. That this is more so as there was no reasonable doubt from the Appellant. The Respondent submitted to the effect that a trial Court is permitted by law to infer from the facts proved and other facts whatever is necessary to complete the element of guilt or establish innocence. That this is what the Lower Court did in the instant case. Hence, that apart from the acceptance of the confessional statements of the Appellant, the direct evidence of the PW4, regarding the involvement of the Appellant in the crime with which he was charged and which was accepted by the Lower Court, justified the adoption by the said Court of the involvement of the Appellant in the crime and therefore a true account as reflected in Exhibits “G”, “L”, “M”, i.e. confessional statement made by the Appellant. That the facts therein were corroborated by the extra judicial statements of one Joseph Anoke one of the suspects in the crime who died before arraignment. Reference was made to Exhibits “E” and “J”.  Posing the question as to the circumstances under which a trial Court can convict an accused based on his confessional statements, the Respondent gave the answer that this can be done upon a free and voluntary confessional statement once it is direct and positive, and satisfactorily proved before the trial Court. That such confessional statement alone, is sufficient to sustain conviction, even if there is no corroborative evidence. That a conviction based on a confessional statement that is properly proved, will not be quashed on appeal merely because it is based entirely on the evidence of confession by the Appellant. That what is important is for the trial Court to be satisfied. It is the stance of the Respondent that in the instant case, a trial within trial was conducted to determine voluntariness of the extra judicial statements of the Appellant and that the Lower Court ruled that they were voluntarily made and duly admitted them in evidence and marked them Exhibits “G”, “L”, “M”, and “N”. Having also catalogued other pieces of evidence in the case, it is the stance of the Respondent that the lower Court had before it sufficient corroborative evidence of the fact that the Appellant was one of the armed robbers even without the extra judicial statements of Joseph Anoke admitted in evidence as Exhibits “E” and “J”. In the circumstances, the Respondent further submitted that the Lower Court was right in finding the Appellant guilty of committing the offence as charged. This is not only because it was based on his Appellant’s confessional statements, marked Exhibits “G”, “L”, “M” and “N”whether or not corroborated by any other evidence but as they were free and voluntary confessions of guilt by the Appellant and direct and positive, and duly made and satisfactorily proved before the said Court by the prosecution witnesses. That what is important is that the Court must be satisfied and this was the position in the instant case. The Court was urged to resolve Appellant’s issues 1 and 3 as well as the first part of Appellant’s issue 2 against him.  APPELLANT’S ISSUE 2: Dwelling on this issue, it is the stance of the Appellant that the Lower Court was wrong when it held that the defence of alibi did not avail him. The Appellant predicated his stance in this regard, on the fact that although he raised a defence of alibi at the earliest opportunity, the police did not discharge the burden of investigating the said alibi. That though on pages 264-265 of the records of appeal, the prosecution adduced evidence that its witness investigated his Appellant’s alibi and found that he did not attend the market on the date of the robbery as he claimed or at all within the week, because the said witness did not see what he Appellant bought from the market, there is however no evidence on record as to how the alibi was investigated. That in any event, the 1st accused who confessed to the offence told the lower Court that he Appellant was not a member of their gang and that nothing connected him with the robbery. The Appellant also attacked the statement made by the Lower Court regarding the impossibility of a transport 911 lorry - to travel to Lafia from Orlu and return within the time stated considering the state of the roads, movement of the vehicle and time in the market by all traders\", in demonstrating that the defence of alibi availed him.  Stating to the effect that he sufficiently raised the defence of alibi, the Appellant submitted that the prosecution did not adduce evidence in disproving the same. That the Lower Court ought not to have rejected his Appellant’s defence of alibi given the fact that the prosecution adduced no evidence to show that the said alibi was investigated not to talk of disproving the same.  This Court was urged to resolve this issue in favour of the Appellant.  Dwelling on the aspect of Appellant’s issue 2 as it relates to the defence of alibi, the Respondent submitted that from the clear facts stated by the Appellant in his confessional statements, i.e. Exhibits “G, “L”, “M”. and “N”, in whatever form one looks them, and when read together with Section 7 of the Criminal Code Act, the only reasonable conclusion one can arrive at in law, is that the Appellant was a party to that armed robbery incident in respect of which he was convicted.  Stating that it is indeed true that the Appellant to be entitled to the beneficent effect of the defence of alibi, the Respondent submitted that he must however raise it at the earliest opportunity; preferably be in his extra-judicial statement. That this is to afford the police an opportunity either to confirm or confute its availability. The Respondent also submitted that such defence of alibi, must be unequivocal as to the particulars of the Appellant’s whereabouts and those present with him. It is the stance of the Respondent that the Appellant raised his defence of alibi during his evidence in Court with some particulars that would have, if raised in his extra judicial statements to the police, led the prosecution to investigate the same. In other words, that the defence of alibi was not available to the Appellant.  The Respondent submitted that the Appellant knew that he was making a mockery of the defence of alibi in this case; hence, none of the individuals the Appellants claimed were with him and who were mentioned in his evidence before the Lower Court, was called by him as a witness in support of his defence of alibi. The Respondent submitted to the effect that in any case, the settled position of the law is that it is not enough for an accused to raise the defence of alibi at the stage of trial. He must give adequate particulars of his whereabouts at the time of the commission of the offence to assist the police to make a meaningful investigation of the alibi. Therefore, that the mere allegation by the Appellant that he was not at the scene is not enough. That in the instant case, the lower Court was left with only the way and manner the Appellant was arrested. That this was unchallenged and that this justified the finding of the said Court in respect of the guilt of the said Appellant. It is the stance of the Respondent that the evidence adduced by the prosecution, regarding how PW4 used the gang’s “criminal-family-slangs” was sufficient evidence that fixed the Appellant at the scene of the crime and that this not only logically but physically demolished the Appellant’s plea of alibi. In concluding, the Respondent urged this Court to dismiss the instant appeal and affirm the judgment of the lower Court.  The Respondent indeed rightly stated the elements of the offence of armed robbery in its brief of argument. They are essentially –  i that there was a robbery or series of robberies;  ii that each of the robbery was an armed robbery; and  iii that the accused person was one of the persons that took part in the robbery.  The prosecution is enjoined by law to prove each of these elements beyond reasonable doubt to sustain a conviction for the offence of armed robbery. See the old cases of BOZIN v. THE STATE 1985 2 NWLR Pt. 8 455; and IKEMSON v. THE STATE 1989 NWLR Pt.110 455; and amongst many others, the recent cases of PEDRO v. STATE 2018 LPELR-44460 SC and GIKI v. STATE 2018 LPELR-43604SC.  The Respondent is also correct in respect of its position as to how an allegation of the commission of a criminal offence may be proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution against an accused person. This is because, the position of the law till date remains that the prosecution may prove the guilt of an accused person by the confessional statement of that accused person, by circumstantial evidence or by the evidence of eye witnesses of the crime. That the prosecution does not always need an eye witness account to succeed in proving its case against an accused person if the charge can otherwise by proved. See amongst others the cases of IGABELE v. THE STATE 2006 6 N.W.L.R. PT. 975 100 and UDOR v. THE STATE 2014 LPELR-23064SC.  I am of the considered view that it is in the knowledge of the position which the law ascribes to a confessional statement that the Appellant in the instant appeal, is challenging the use to which the lower Court put his statements to the Police and particularly those he claimed the principle of non est factum applied to; and his stance regarding the wrongful reliance on the said statements by the lower Court to convict him.  In my considered view, the arguments which the Appellant has weaved around his statements admitted and marked Exhibits “L”, “M”, “N” bring to the fore the questions as to when a confessional statement can be said to have been properly admitted in evidence in the course of a trial as such, and once so admitted whether the Court must close its eyes to the same, because the maker has retracted the same in the course of his evidence before the trial Court.  Confession and its making are matters provided for under the Evidence Act. The law is clear from decided cases as to what a confessional statement is. Going by Section 28 of the Evidence Act, a confessional statement is a statement made at any time by a person charged with a crime, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that crime. Such a statement is admissible if it is direct and positive and relates to his own acts, knowledge or intention, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed the crime charged. See amongst many others the cases of AKPAN V STATE 1992 7 SCNJ 22 and AZABADA v. THE STATE 2014 LPELR-23017SC. This is why a statement made to the Police by an accused person in the course of Police investigation into a crime that is the subject matter of a charge before a Court and in which an accused person had admitted or suggested the inference that he committed the offence, is always relevant and will be admitted where the accused person does not deny the making of the statement voluntarily; andor where he denies making the statement at all. In a situation where an accused does not deny making a statement alleged by the prosecution to be confessional, but claims not to have made it voluntarily, then the requirement of the law is that such a statement is not admissible in evidence against the accused person unless it is shown by the prosecution that it was a voluntary statement. This must be done by the Court embarking on a trial within trial. This is to enable the trial Judge determine whether or not the prosecution has established that the statement containing the confession was made voluntarily; and to the extent that the Judge is so satisfied, the same will be admitted in evidence and duly marked as an exhibit tendered by the prosecution. See GBADAMOSI v. THE STATE 1992 NWLR Pt. 266465 and STATE v. IBRAHIM 2019 LPELR-47548SC. Similarly, it is the settled position of the law that a confessional statement which an accused person denies making at the point of its being tendered, is admissible in evidence despite the denial. See the cases of IKEMSON v. THE STATE supra, AWOPEJU v. THE STATE 2002 3 MJSC 141 and AMOS v. STATE 2018 LPELR-44694SC.  Having regard to the submissions of the Appellant highlighted hereinbefore, I am of the considered view that he is not challenging the correctness of the admission in evidence of Exhibits “L”, “M” and “N” because he did not make them voluntarily. In the same vein, the Appellant by excluding Exhibit “G”, in my considered view would appear to be saying that the principle of non est factum is not applicable to the said Exhibit. I have hereinbefore reproduced a portion of the judgment of the Lower Court that deals with the statements of the Appellant admitted in evidence in the instant case. The portion reads: - “Before that, let me state that the statements of the 3rd accused i.e. D.W.3 made on 17398, 20398, 24398 and 7598 were admitted in evidence as Exhibits G, L, M and N followed the ruling of this Court on 15th October, 1999 in a trial within trial by which the objection of counsel to the admission of the statement made 17th March, 1998 was over ruled. I am bound by that ruling.”  I cannot but observe that it is not very clear to me, whether what the Lower Court in the portion of its judgment reproduced above, was saying is that all the other statements made by the Appellant including the one he made on 1731998, were admitted after a trial within trial was conducted to determine their admissibility respectively; or whether what the said Court was saying,was that it admitted all the other statements made by the Appellant, as it was bound by its ruling made in respect of the statement of the Appellant on 15101999, in relation to the one made on 1731998, and which was admitted in evidence and marked as Exhibit “G”, on 15101999. I however have not seen any ruling of the Lower Court delivered on 15101999, in the records of appeal. The originals of the Exhibits in this case being also untraceable by the Exhibit Keeper of this Court, there is nothing by which I can solve the puzzle I have identified. Happily, the Appellant who has raised the issue of non est factum has not tied his submissions thereon to Exhibit “G”, i.e. the first statement which he made to the Police on 1731998, and in respect of which a trial within trial was conducted. Indeed, the Appellant relied on the said Exhibit on page 7 of his amended brief of argument to his own advantage by relying on it as his statement in which he gave the Police his alibi.  Also having regard to the notes of proceedings on pages 110-111, of the records of appeal, it becomes undisputable that it was the three statements of the Appellant recorded by PW6, an IPO in the case from State CID, Anti Robbery Section Owerri, that were admitted as Exhibits “L” “M” and “N”. See pages 105 and 110-111 of the records of appeal. I am of the considered opinion or view, that this would appear to be the only reason why the Appellant being conscious of the fact that he cannot properly rely on the principle of non est factum in respect of his statement that was admitted in evidence and marked as Exhibit “G” after a trial within trial, that he related his submissions on the said principle to Exhibits “L”“M” and “N”.  However, I cannot but say that the principle of non est factum would appear not to avail the Appellant in the instant case given the illuminating manner in which the Supreme Court enunciated the principle in the case of AIGUOREGHIAN v. THE STATE 2004 3 MJSC 71, relied on by the Appellant. It was stated thus: - Be it noted that it is trite that when a document is sought to be tendered and is objected to by counsel, what counsel objecting does at that stage is no more than a submission on the admissibility of the statement. Thus, as the issue of non-est factum is a matter of fact, the challenge of such a statement is more properly done when the accused or any other witness of his impugns the statement as not being that of the accused from the witness box. I agree with learned counsel for 2nd Appellant therefore that as counsel is not competent to give evidence from the bar and the challenge of a confessional statement on grounds of non-est factum is a matter of fact, the challenge is appropriately made when the accused as witness denies the making of such a statement.  As I had cause to observe in Nwangbomu v. State 1994 2 NWLR Pt. 327 380, a case identical to the one in hand: \"...Now the voluntary statement of the Appellant which was confessional in nature was received in the proceedings giving rise to this appeal as Exhibits B and B1 and these are part of the prosecution’s case. See Anofi Opayemi v. The State 1985 2 NWLR Pt. 5 101. The Appellant for his defence in rendering his testimony in Court, admitted he never said what was recorded. He thereby sought to retract the statement rather than its involuntariness that was in issue.\"  In view of the appropriate attack of the Appellants of the statement Exhibits “A” and C as not being their deeds, it was incumbent on the Courts below to have made a finding on whether the said statements were actually made by the Appellants before holding that the statements were retracted or before putting them into any use in convicting the Appellants.  It is noteworthy to stress that the terms \"retraction\" \"resile from\" have been used interchangeably in most decisions with the pleas of non-est factum. This is misleading since a statement must first be shown to have been made before it can be said to have been retracted by its maker for where the very making of the statement is in issue, the retraction cannot arise at that stage. It is in this wise that I agree that where an accused person sets up a defence of non-est factum in relation to a confessional statement what he has done is not a retraction but a denial of the making of the statement.  No finding was made by the two Courts below on the issue of fact as to whether the Appellants made the statements. The application therefore of the rule in Oladejo v. The State 1987 3 NWLR Pt. 61 419 and Asanya v. The State 1991 3 NWLR Pt. 480 422, two cases that have been overruled, was therefore prejudicial to the Appellants whose conviction ought not to be allowed to stand. See Egboghonome v. The State 1993 7 NWLR Pt. 306 383. What it boils down to is that had the testimony of the 2nd Appellant and his extra-judicial statement Exhibit C not been treated as unreliable, the 2nd Appellant would have been absolved of the offence of murder of the deceased based on his defence of alibi which was not investigated. Furthermore, the evidence of PW2 who himself was a victim of the same attack, ought not to have been viewed with as much confidence as the Trial Court below did, it being the evidence of a victim.”  I have expressed the view that the principle of non est factum cannot avail the Appellant when under examination in chief he stated on page 170 of the record thus: - “I deny the offence as alleged. Following my arrest and charge, I made a total of 4 statements on 17.0398, 200398, 240398 and 070598. I do not rely on them as part of my defence because they were not voluntarily made. The fact is as ff sic  Similarly, under cross-examination, he stated on page 189 of the records of appeal thus: - “It is true that I allegedly made four statements to the Police but I denied them as I made them under duress. In my statements, I started sic how I was arrested but what was recorded was not what I said in full. I emphasized that I made the statements under torture. It wasn’t all I stated that were recorded. That was why I petitioned the inspector General against the Police.” See many other pages of the records of appeal after this i.e. page 189, wherein the Appellant disclosed his reason for “disowning” his statements admitted as confessional statements.  It is in my considered view, obvious from what was stated above, that the reliance by the Appellant on the principle of non est factum, in respect of his statements recorded by PW6 and which statements  he did not oppose at the point of their being tendered, but only to disclose in his evidence that he did so, because he did not consider the said statements as having been voluntarily made, shows that the strategy adopted by the Appellant, is one that has now gone bad. I have before now referred to the pages of the records of appeal, containing the statements made by the Appellant to the Police. It is obvious therefrom, that in each of the statements the Appellant disclosed himself as being privy to the robbery in question; at least as one of the planners and also as having acted as a pointer. The statements made by the Appellant, therefore were rightly found by the Lower Court to be confessional statements and upon which the lower Court could have rightly acted; and indeed, rightly acted upon by the said Court in convicting the Appellant for the offence of armed robbery with which he was charged. This is more so, in the light of the evidence of PW4 as to how the Appellant came to be apprehended and which the lower Court believed, and which I cannot find any basis for faulting the same. This is more so as a trial Judge is the sole determinant of facts and law at the trial stage. See the old case of ABDULLAHI v. THE STATE  1985 LPELR-29SC, 1985 NWLR Pt. 3 523, wherein the Supreme Court stated thus: - \"It has been established by several authorities that a Court of Appeal must approach the findings of fact of a Trial Court with extreme caution. This is because a Court of Appeal has not had the advantage which the trial judge has enjoyed of seeing the witnesses and watching their demeanour. A Court of Appeal would only disturb the findings of fact of a trial Court where it is satisfied that the trial Court has made no use of such an advantage. If the trial judge has evaluated the evidence before him, it is not for the Court of Appeal to re-evaluate the same evidence and come to its own decision.”  Indeed, I cannot but say that it is clear from the judgment of the Lower Court that it never found corroboration for the statement of the Appellant in the statement of the deceased suspect - Anoke. The Lower Court only commented to the effect that the confessional statements of the Appellant corroborated that of the said deceased suspect. I am of the considered view that there is a world of difference, in the two situations. Suffice it to say that as the Lower Court in its judgment relied on many facts apart from the alleged corroboration it was wrongly said to have found for the statements of the Appellant in the statement of the deceased Anoke, rendering the confessional statements of the Appellant to be probable, its reliance on the same, is eminently correct. Flowing from all that has been said before now, is that I cannot but find the lower Court to be correct in accepting and treating the statements of the Appellant as confessional statements and in relying on them in convicting the Appellant.  This is more so as the Appellant did not introduce any reasonable doubt into the prima facie case established against him, by the evidence adduced by the prosecution.  The question as to whether an accused person has introduced reasonable doubt in a criminal charge as established against him by the evidence led by the prosecution, is always a fact for resolution in a criminal trial. This, being the position, there is no dearth of authorities in respect of terms like “beyond reasonable doubt” and “reasonable doubt”. One of the cases in which the meaning of the terms was considered is the old case of BAKARE v.THE STATE 1987 3 S.C 1. Therein, the Supreme Court dwelling on “proof beyond reasonable doubt” vis-a-vis “reasonable doubt” stated thus: - “In his Brief, which was too brief to be of much use, learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that \"there is only one issue for determination in this appeal; viz \"whether or not the prosecution had proved its case beyond every reasonable doubt\". From the particulars of errormisdirection supporting this ground of appeal which were further elaborated in the Brief, it is obvious that there is here a thorough misconception of the requirement that the prosecution should prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Proof beyond reasonable doubt stems out of the compelling presumption of innocence inherent in our adversary system of criminal justice. To displace this presumption, the evidence of the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt, not beyond the shadow of any doubt that the person accused is guilty of the offence charged. Absolute certainty is impossible in any human adventure including the administration of criminal justice. Proof beyond reasonable doubt means just what it says. It does not admit of plausible and fanciful possibilities but it does admit of a high degree of cogency, consistent with an equally high degree of probability. As Denning, J. as he then was observed in Miller v. Minister of Pensions 1947 2 All. E.R. 373: - \"The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence - of course it is possible but not in the least probable the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt\".... Also it has to be noted that there is no burden on the prosecution to prove its case beyond all doubt. No. The burden is to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt with emphasis on reasonable. Not all doubts are reasonable. Reasonable doubt will automatically exclude unreasonable doubt, fanciful doubt, imaginary doubt and speculative doubt - a doubt not borne out by the facts and surrounding circumstances of the case.  Another sense in which the expression \"Proof beyond Reasonable Doubt\" is used refers to the shifting of the onus of proof as stipulated by Section 1371 Evidence Act Cap 62 of 1958: - \"1371 If the commission of a crime by a party to any proceedings directly in issue... it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.\"  But if the prosecution proves the commission of a crime beyond reasonable doubt then the burden of proving reasonable doubt is shifted onto the accused - see Section 1373 of Cap 62 of 1958. What does this subsection mean in relation to the case now on appeal? It means this. At the close of the prosecution case the Court had heard 9 witnesses testified. If the prosecution witnesses were believed and there was nothing urged in defence, no fair 'minded jury can return any verdict except that of guilty. In other words the prosecution established this case beyond reasonable doubt. The onus then shifted to the defence to adduce evidence capable of creating some reasonable doubt in the mind of the trial Judge. The primary onus of establishing the guilt of the Appellant was still on the prosecution and this does and did not shift. What does shift is the secondary onus or the onus of adducing some evidence which may render the prosecution case improbable and therefore unlikely to be true and thereby create a reasonable doubt:- R. v. Harry Lazarus Lobell 1957 41 C.R. App. R. 100 at p.104 per Goddard L.C.J... “Evidence that is not accepted cannot possibly create a doubt in the mind of a fair minded jury. If the defence account of the incident is disbelieved then that is the end of the story and there will then be no evidence on which to consider the existence of a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal was right in holding that the case was proved beyond reasonable doubt...” See also the cases of UCHE v. THE STATE 2015 LPELR-24693SC and ANKPEGHER v. STATE 2018 LPELR-43906SC, and many others which decide nothing different from what the same Court did on the issue of “proof beyond reasonable doubt” and “reasonable doubt” in the Bakare case supra.  Having read and highlighted the submissions of the parties in this appeal, it is obvious that the reasonable doubt the Appellant sought to introduce into the case of the prosecution, is that he could not have been arrested in connection with the robbery in respect of which he was charged, because he was not within or at the area or scene of the robbery incident of 1731998 as he was somewhere else and whereat he was arrested. That in the circumstances he could not be rightly found to be one of the robbers that escaped into the bush shortly after the robbery in question. Undoubtedly, this is a defence of alibi. I do not believe that the consideration of this defence requires a re-statement of the position of the law in respect of the meaning of alibi and all its nitty-gritty. I however consider it pertinent to say that it is settled in law, that non-investigation of alibi where it was given to the Police at the earliest opportunity by the accused person, cannot ipso facto result in the finding of such alibi as established or to have a destructive effect on the case of the prosecution. This in my considered view was the position of the Supreme Court in the old case of HAUSA V THE STATE 1994 6 NWLR Pt. 350 281 wherein it was said: - “It appears to me that none of these issues called for wholesale re-evaluation of the evidence adduced at the trial of the Appellant. Although the defence of alibi was not investigated by the police it is clear from the testimonies of P.W.2 and P.W.3 that the Appellant was seen and identified as the assailant of the deceased. ... As both P.W.2 and P.W.3 were believed by the learned trial Judge, the defence of alibi set up by the Appellant becomes untenable, even though the police failed to investigate it. The absence of the investigation is not in the circumstances of this case fatal to the case of the prosecution “ See ...  In the case of Ntam v. State 1968 NMLR 86, which is similar to the present case, Brett, J.S.C. stated as follows: “There are occasions on which a failure to check an alibi may cause doubt on the reliability of the case for the prosecution, but in a case such as this in here the appellants were identified by three eyewitnesses there was a straight issue of credibility and we are notable to say that the Judge’s findings of fact were unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.”  Moreover, in Njovens & Ors. v. State, 1973 5 S.C. 17, Coker J.S.C. made the following observation at p. 65 thereof: “There is nothing extraordinary or esoteric in a plea of alibi. Such a plea postulates that the accused person could have been at a scene of the crime and only inferentially that he was not there. Even if it is the duty of the prosecution to check on a statement of alibi by an accused person and disprove the alibi or attempt to do so, there is no inflexible andor invariable way of doing this of the prosecution adduced sufficient and accepted evidence to fix the person at the scene of the crime at the material time. Surely, his alibi is thereby logically and physically demolished.” emphasis mine.  Therefore, these authorities clearly established that the failure to investigate the defence of alibi set up by the Appellant in the present case is not fatal to the case for the prosecution since the testimonies of P.W.2 and P.W.3 who were eyewitnesses had been accepted and believed by the learned trial Judge...”  I know of no decided case that has put on ground the principle that the non-investigation of alibi supplied by an accused person as a suspect to the Police by the Police to whom it is given, without more renders the case of the prosecution unreliable.  The Appellant in any case, testified in respect of his alibi. The question therefore is, whether the Appellant by the evidence he adduced before the lower Court established his alibi which by law he is required to do on a balance of probability and not beyond reasonable doubt. It is to be noted that the Lower Court in evaluating the evidence in the instant case in relation to the alibi of the Appellant observed to the effect that persons with whom the Appellant claimed to be with, shortly before the time of his arrest or those that were with him prior to his arrest, were not called by him as witnesses. I am of the considered view that a defence of alibi except where it is that a person was alone by himself and never interacted with any known or identifiable person, cannot be said to be proved on the mere ipse dixit of the person setting up the defence. It is my considered view, that common sense in fact dictates that a person who claimed to be with other persons at a different location from where a crime he is charged with is alleged to have happened, owes himself the duty to call if not all the persons he claimed to have been with, he should at least call one of them. The Appellant would appear to believe that whatever he says in Court must be accepted as gospel truth. Likewise, the Appellant would appear to believe that the fact that the 1st accused person testified that he Appellant was not a member of his gang sufficiently proved his alibi. He is wrong. The Appellant in my considered view never gave any worthwhile evidence in support of his alibi and it would surely have been a case of a perverse finding, if the lower Court found the Appellant to have established his alibi given the evidence of PW4 on pages 71-75 of the records of appeal. At pages 72-73, the witness is recorded as having testified thus: - “... While there, I saw the 1st accused running. I pursued him and caught him and dispossessed him of a pistol he was holding. I gave him a matchet cut on the right leg when he attempted to shoot me with the pistol. The pistol I recovered from him is stainless white. I handed over the pistol and the 1st accused to the Police. When I caught him he informed me there was another left in the bush. He also gave me the call sign of “Oyi” “Oyi” and that once I so shouted, he would think that it was he that I called. That was their call sign. On entry into the bush I called as was directed and the 3rd accused replied. When he saw me and realised that I was not his member he took to his heels. I then pursued and caught him. When I came back with him to the scene where the vehicle fell down we lifted the vehicle and found one double barrel gun. ... I went to the Police Station. It was there that I handed over the 3rd accused. That was at Orlu Police Station.”  Against the backdrop of all that has been said in relation to alibi, I am of the considered view that it becomes apparent that given the evidence of PW4, which the lower Court believed and which I cannot but observe was not challenged with any measure of success, that whatever alibi the Appellant set up in his statements, particularly the first of the statements, which he heavily relied on in the instant appeal, must crumble. The Appellant therefore, cannot be said to have introduced any reasonable doubt into the case of the prosecution by his evidence regarding his alibi which the lower Court did not believe and indeed, could not have believed given its Lower Court acceptance of the evidence of PW4.  Flowing from all that has been said is that the three issues formulated for the determination of the instant appeal by the Appellant are resolved against him; while the two issues formulated by the Respondent are resolved in its favour.  In the final analysis, the instant appeal fails and must be dismissed and is hereby dismissed. The prosecution in my considered view clearly proved its case against the Appellants beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the judgment delivered by the Lower Court, convicting the Appellant of the offence of armed robbery and sentencing him to death therefore, is affirmed.   ITA GEORGE MBABA, J.C.A.:  I agree with the reasoning and conclusions of my learned brother, A.O. Lokulo-Sodipe JCA, in the lead judgment, that this Appeal lacks merit. I too dismiss it.   IBRAHIM ALI ANDENYANGTSO, J.C.A.:  I have the privilege of reading in draft the judgment just delivered by my Noble Lord A. O Lokulo-Sodipe, JCA. I agree with his reasoning and conclusion that this appeal lacks merit. The facts of the case, and arguments of Counsel on both sides, have been succinctly captured in the lead judgment. I can only emphasize that the Appellant has made a mountain of the plea of alibi, which in law has certain requirements to be satisfied before the Court in order for the Appellant to reap the benefit thereof. The Appellant by law is expected to provide enough particulars, and this, very timeously, for the Police to investigate. Where the Appellant made a blanket statement that he was not at the scene of crime without more, he cannot have the benefit of that defence enured to him.  In the instant case, the Appellant alleged that he was in Lafia in Nasarawa State at the time of commission of the crime.  This, the trial Judge found incredible and disbelieved same. It is not the law that once a defence of an alibi is set up, then it becomes sacrosanct and must of necessity absolve the Appellant of culpability in a criminal trial. It has been held by the Supreme Court in the case of NJOVENS & ORS VS. STATE 1975 5 S.C 17 PER COKER J.S.C AT PAGE 65 that: “There is nothing extraordinary or esoteric in a plea of alibi. Such a plea postulates that the accused person could have been at the scene of the crime and only inferentially that he was not there. Even if it is the duty of the prosecution to check on a statement of alibi by an accused person and disprove the alibi or attempt to do so, there is no inflexible andor invariable way of doing this if the prosecution adduced sufficient and accepted evidence to fix the person at the scene of the crime at the material time.”  In other word, the word “ALIBI” is not a magic wand.  In the instant case, the evidence as found and accepted by the trial Court is overwhelming. See the evidence of PW4 at pages 71 -75 of the Record of Appeal.  Based on the above and fuller reasons advanced by my Noble Lord Lokulo-Sodipe JCA, I find no merit in this appeal and same is hereby dismissed. The judgment of the trial Court is hereby affirmed by me.-end!" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The Appellant was the 3rd accused person in Charge No. HOW/ART/21/99 whereunder the Appellant and 3 others were charged with the offence of armed robbery contrary to Section 1(2)(a) of the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Act, Cap. 398, Laws of Federation of Nigeria, 1990. In the particulars of offence, the Appellant and the 3 other accused persons and other still at large - while armed with firearms - were alleged to have robbed one John Nwokeocha and his passengers of one Mercedes Benz 911 Lorry with Registration No. AE 281 and money totaling N260,715.00, on 17/3/1998 at Mgbee along OrluUrualla-Akaokwa Road in Orlu Judicial Division. The charge was read over to the accused persons including the Appellant on 10/8/1999, and each of them pleaded not guilty thereto.  The prosecution called 6 witnesses in proof of its case against the Appellant and the other accused persons. The Appellant and each of the other accused persons, testified on their own behalf, and called no witness.  In its judgment, the trial court noted that the 1st accused person in the charge before it, namely John Okorie confessed to the crime and that the other accused persons (Appellant inclusive) in their evidence denied the charge. The Court found the prosecution to have proved its case against the Appellant and 2 of the other accused persons but not in respect of the 4th accused person. Hence, the Court convicted the Appellant and 2 of the other accused persons of the offence preferred against them and sentenced the Appellant and 2 of the other accused persons to death as mandated by the law under which they were charged. The 4th accused person in the charge, having been found not guilty, was acquitted and discharged.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  ITA GEORGE MBABA, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  This Appeal is against the judgment of Imo State High Court in Suit No. HOW982007, delivered on 11th March, 2013, by Hon.  Justice Ngozi Opara, wherein the trial Court gave judgment to the Claimants now Respondents. The trial Court had earlier on 2352011 granted an order of Interlocutory Injunction in favour of the Claimants, affirming the order of renewal of the originating process, which the Appellant had challenged as having expired 3 years before the Respondents sought an order for its renewal. Appellant filed this Notice of Appeal on 20313 against both the said interlocutory decision and the final judgment, grounds 1 - 3, relating to the interlocutory decision and grounds 4 - 8, relating to the final judgment. See pages 251 - 268 of the Records of Appeal.  At the Lower Court, the Respondents as Claimants had sought: 1 Declaration that the Claimants are entitled to the Statutory Right of Occupancy over the land known as UZO AMAKOHIA EGBELU UMUIMEKA, or Plot 199 Works Layout, Owerri, Imo State. 2 The sum of N10,000,000 Ten Million Naira damages for trespass. 3 Perpetual Injunction restraining the defendant, his privies, agents, workers and servants from further trespass on the land of the Claimants.  Appellant said the Appeal begins from the trial Court’s interlocutory decision of 2352011, dismissing the Appellant’s application of 1412011, challenging the trial Court’s jurisdiction to entertain this matter upon an incompetent originating process. He relied on the case of Nwoko Vs Azakwe 2012 NWLR Pt.1313 151 at 156, to the effect that, where a party is aggrieved by the interlocutory decision of Court and final judgment, he is entitled to cause one notice of appeal to be filed against both decisions.  Appellant filed his brief of arguments on 21317 and distilled three 3 Issues for the determination of the Appeal, as follows: 1 Whether there was a competent originating process in this matter at the trial Court, upon which the Court conducted and determined the matter. Ground 1 - 3 2 Whether the trial Court’s final judgment of 11th March, 2013 in this matter was not against the weight of evidence, especially considering the fact that the said Court ignored and did not consider the Chart document from Lands Registry Owerri - Exhibit 7, which charted the res, Plot 199 Works Layout, Owerri into the expanse of land DW2, acquired from Declan Amadi,  native of Umuimeka, Orji, Owerri, to whom Appellant traced his Donor’s title. Grounds 5 - 8 3 Whether the trial Court did not breach the Appellant’s right to fair hearing, when on the 11th March, 2013, before delivering its judgment, it ignored the Appellant’s protest that the Respondents’ final written address was not served on him, for him to exercise his right of reply on points of law. Ground 4  The Respondents filed a preliminary objection to the hearing of the Appeal, saying that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear the Appeal, because the Respondents had already executed the judgment and passed interest to a 3rd party. In the alternative, the Respondents filed their brief of arguments and adopted the three 3 Issues distilled by Appellants for the determination of the Appeal.  Appellant filed a Reply Brief on 1552019 to react to the preliminary objection.  When this appeal was finally heard on 41219, the Respondents referred us to the preliminary objection, which they adopted and urged us to strike out the Appeal. The parties adopted their briefs and urged us, accordingly.  On the Preliminary Objection, the Respondents argued that the subject matter of the Suit for which judgment was given to the Respondents on 1132013, that is, Plot 199 Works Layout, Owerri, has passed to a 3rd party Mr. Okechukwu Opara by power of Attorney, dated 16th March, 2013, and that the said Power of Attorney was later registered by the Donee at the Lands Registry, Owerri, on 2832013 - Exhibit A; that because of that, there is nothing more in contention between Appellant and the Respondents, the Respondents having divested themselves of all interests in the property, the subject matter of the Suit.  Appellant’s reply was that the notice of preliminary objection was frivolous, misconceived, grossly incompetent and brought in utmost bad faith, with the intention to deny the Appellant his constitutional right of Appeal as enshrined in the Section 241 of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria, as amended.  RESOLUTION OF THE PRELIMINARY OBJECTION I agree with the Appellant, that the so-called preliminary objection by the Respondents is just a ploy to stall or deny the Appellant the right to exercise his constitutional rights of Appeal, stipulated in Section 241 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended. The fact that the Respondents hurriedly transferred the subject matter of the Suit to a 3rd party on 1632013, upon getting judgment on 1132013 less than a week of getting the judgment cannot, in my opinion, discount or diminish the constitutional rights of the Appellant to appeal against the said judgment. If anything, I think the said 3rd party, who took the risk of buying or taking interest in the subject matter of the Suit Plot 199 Works Layout, Owerri, soon after the judgment, which recognized the Respondents right to the land, was, or should have been, on due notice of this appeal, and by so doing, also acquired interest in every encumbrance associated with the property and would be free to join or be joined as an interested party to the Appeal, if he so elected. The Respondents are, therefore, in error to think that passing their interest in the subject matter of the Suit to a 3rd party has robbed this Court of the jurisdiction to entertain the Appeal, brought by a party to the Suit, against the other party in the Suit, and all of them, parties on record in this Appeal.  By law, however, every judgment of a Court is expected to come to effect upon the delivery of the judgment, but the law also allows a window of 90 days, generally except in election related matters, for a dissatisfied party to appeal and that period can even be extended, upon application by the person seeking to appeal. Thus, even the winning party is expected to exercise some restraint, during that period of 90 days, and must not dissipate the res or act to frustrate the aggrieved party from exercising his right of appeal. See PETGAS RESOURCES LTD VS MBANEFO 2017 LPELR - 42760 SC.  In the case of Ngere & Anor Vs Chief Okuruket “XIV” & Ors 2014 LPELR - 22883 SC, my Lord, Rhodes - Vivour, JSC said: “Judgments take effect immediately they are delivered and every Court has inherent power to proceed to enforce judgments at once. The enforcements on delivery can only be interrupted by a stay of execution, provided there is an appeal.” But, as earlier stated, where there is an appeal against the decision of a Court, the successful party therein is expected to exercise caution in victory, and no party is expected to take any step or action that will render the decision of the Appellate Court, nugatory, upon the determination of the appeal. That imposes a duty on every party and on the Court, to protect and preserve the res. See Lawal Osula & Ors Vs Lawal-Osula & Ors 1995 LPELR - 1763 SC: “It is the duty of the Courts to protect and ensure that orders lawfully made are not rendered useless or nugatory by the action and conduct of the parties. See Gov. of Lagos State Vs Ojukwu 1986 3 NWLR Pt.26 39 and Obeya Memorial Specialist Hospital Vs A.G. of Federation 1987 3 NWLR Pt.60 325.”  In the case of Lekwot & Ors Vs J.T.ON C& CD IN KADUNA STATE & ANOR 1997 LPELR - 1778 SC, it was held: “both the Court from which an appeal lies as well as the Court to which the appeal lies have the duty of ensuring that the appeal, if successful, is not rendered nugatory and that the Court will make an order to that end. See Kigo Nig. Ltd Vs Holman Bros. Nig Ltd 1980 5 - 7 SC 60.” To that end, I think, the fact that a 3rd party throws caution to the winds and opts to take interest buy in a res, soon after the judgment of the Lower Court andor during the pendency of appeal over the judgment, would not diminish the powers or jurisdiction of the appellate Court to go ahead with the appeal, to determine the interest of the parties on record in the appeal, as they were at the Court below.  The preliminary objection is therefore, dismissed for lack of merit.  Arguing the Appeal, Appellant’s Counsel K.E. Owuamalam Esq., on Issue 1, said the life - span of the originating process was 6 months, and where for any reason, it proved impossible to serve it on the defendant within its life-span, it can only be renewed by the application, brought before the originating process expires, not after. He relied on Order 6 Rules 61 & 2 and 7 of Imo State High Court Civil Procedure Rules, 2008, which also allows or permits only 2 renewals making maximum renewals of 12 months of originating process. Counsel said in this case, the Originating process was issued on 2222007 and that the same expired; that the trial Court, on 1642010 made the order setting aside the illegal service of the process on the Appellant. But that the Respondents neither applied to have the Originating process renewed before its expiration nor applied for extension of time within which to renew it; they merely brought an application, ex-parte, after joining issues with Appellant on the subject of the expiration of the originating process, after 3 years from 2222007, when the process expired.  He relied on the Originating process, on pages 1 - 4 of the Records and paragraph 11 of the Appellant’s Affidavit of 1412011 page 33 of the Records, challenging the jurisdiction of the trial Court to entertain the Suit. He also relied on Abubakar Vs Nasamu 2012 17 NWLR Pt.1330 523 at 546.  Counsel said it was wrong for the trial Court to dismiss Appellant’s challenge to the Suit on 23511, and to re-affirm its earlier order, renewing the originating process on 22102010. He urged us to resolve the issue for Appellant.  Counsel further argued that the Respondents got the originating process renewed by an ex-parte order, thereby shutting out the Appellant on the issue and denying him of fair hearing; that this happened after Appellant had raised the issue of the expiration of the writ and challenged the jurisdiction of the trial Court to entertain the same See the Motion of Appellant filed on 14610 to which the Respondents joined issues, saying the originating process had not expired. He submitted that a decision reached in contravention of the right of fair hearing of a party is null and void, relying Section 36 of the Constitution of Nigeria, 1999; Tamiti Vs NSCB 2009 7 NWLR Pt.1141 631. He added that the renewal of the originating process by means of an ex-parte order had overreached the motion of the Appellant filed on 1462010 to challenge the said originating process. He relied on the Order 5 Rule 2 of the Imo State High Court Civil Procedure Rules, 2008, which state: “An application to set aside for irregularity any step taken in the course of any proceedings, may be allowed where it is made within a reasonable time and before the party applying has taken any fresh step, after becoming aware of the irregularity.”  He said that Appellant had promptly filed the motion on 1462010 challenging the process, upon being served with the expired process, without filing statement of defence. Thus, that application was over-reached, when the trial Court entertained the motion ex-parte, filed on 19112010 to renew the originating process. And even when Appellant further challenged the trial Court’s order, renewing the originating process as per the motion filed on 1412011 the trial Court still affirmed it, on 23511.  He relied on the case of Nwoko Vs Azakwo 2012 12 NWLR Pt.1313 151 at 153 to say that: “Service of Court process is a precondition to the jurisdiction of the Court. Failure to serve a defendant with originating summons in a suit is a fundamental vice. This is because the service of originating processes is a condition precedent for the exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action and over the parties.” Counsel also relied on Tsokwa Motors Nig. Ltd Vs UBA PLC 2008 ALL FWLR Pt.403 1240 at 1242, to the effect that non service of a Court process renders the proceedings on such unserved process null and void. He argued that Appellants was not served with the originating statement of claim, but was served with the renewed writ with fresh statement of claim in December, 2010 which Statement of claim, Counsel said, was the same as one endorsed on the expired writ. He said that the Respondents however applied to file amended pleading but the application was never heard. Counsel also argued that the fresh statement of claim endorsed on “the renewed writ in this Suit, being different from the one in the originating process which the trial Court never ordered a renewal, is incompetent. It is not the one with which the Originating Process was filed and issued on the February, 2007, ordered for renewal on the 22nd November, 2007.”  He said that, because it is incompetent, all witness depositions and the survey plan placed on it, plus the conduct of the trial, up to the 11th March, 2013 which judgment was delivered were equally incompetent, being materials placed on nothing, and cannot stand. See Macfoy Vs UAC Ltd 1962 SC 152; Aladegbemi Vs Fasanmade 1988 3 NWLR Pt.81 129.  Counsel concluded by saying that, the trial Court should have set aside the Suit, at the interlocutory stage, upon being confronted by the vitiating grounds argued above, but regrettably, the trial Court failed to do so, and rather dismissed Appellant’s application of 1412011. He relied on WAEC Vs Akinola O. Akinkunmi 2008 9 NWLR P.1091 151 at 157, to urge us to resolve the issue for Appellant, saying that “where a Suit is not initiated by due process of law, the Suit is incompetent, and where the Suit was heard by a Court, the proceedings before the Court are a nullity.”  On Issue 2, Counsel said assuming without conceding that the Originating Process on which the matter was conducted and determined, was competent, that the Respondents failed, woefully, to prove their claim of ownership of the land in dispute. He referred us to the 5 different ways of proving title to land as per the case of Clement Odunukwe v. Dennis Ofomata & Oyibojiobi Ofomata 2011 ALL FWLR Pt.568 827 at 830. Counsel said the Respondents had relied on 4 out of the five ways of proving title to land; and said that the onus was on them to prove any of the four ways, and that, on the strength of their case, especially, proving that they were in possession of the connected or adjacent plots of land to the land in dispute, in circumstances rendering it probable that being the owners of the adjacent plots, the land in dispute in addition, belonged to them. He argued that the evidence by the Respondents failed to establish their claim. He argued that the Respondents did not clearly trace the boundaries of the land in dispute; that their star witness in paragraph 8 of his further witness deposition pages 158 - 160 of the Records stated that Declan Amadi to whom the Defendant Appellant traced his Donor’s title, owned and sold to DW2, Plots 200, 201 and 203 which are adjacentconnected plots to the land in dispute - plot 199 Works Layout Owerri; that under cross examination, the said witness said he did not know who Thaddeus Dike was, contradicting his earlier evidence that he and other claimants sold plot 205 Work Layout to Thaddeus Dike; he said that that lie put to peg that all plots, including the one in dispute charted into the site survey plan of DW2, as purchased from Declan Amadi - a Kinsman of the Claimants - shown in Exhibit 7, were all owned by DW2, as purchased from Declan Amadi to whom the Defendant traced his donors title to the land in dispute.  He relied on the case ofUkaegbu Vs Nwololo 2009 ALL FWLR Pt. 466 1852 at 1859, on the duty of a claimant to show exactly and precisely a defined and identifiable area to which his claim relates.  He said that Appellant had demonstrated his Donor’s ownership of the land in evidence, from page 188 to 192 of the Records of Appeal by tendering the original copy of the Power of Attorney given to him by his Donor - one Raymond Chindo Ndubuaka - Exhibit 3, and the Survey Plan Exhibit 4 as well as the certified true copy of the irrevocable power of attorney, issued by the Land Registry, dated 1862004 and registered as No. 68, Volume 68, at page 915 by which Sylvester Ojiegbe alienated the land in dispute plot 199 Works Layout, Owerri to the Donor Exhibit 5; that Appellant further tendered the certificate of occupancy given to the said Sylvester Ojiegbe dated 1921986 and registered as No. 86, Volume 86, Page 139 in respect of the said land - Exhibit 6; that he further tendered as 1D1, the Chart document on which the land plot 199 Works Layout, Owerri was Chartedlocated into DW2’s site Survey Plan which was later admitted as Exhibit 7.  Counsel said, the combined effect of the above exhibits, Appellant’s pleadings and evidence in Court including witness depositions, put to rest the question of who owned the land in dispute, as they all traced the Appellant’s Donor’s title to Sylvester Ojiegbe, to Cornelius Iro Iwe - DW2, to the Original native owner of the land - Declan Amadi of Umuimeka Orji, who the Claimants admitted owned an expanse of land in the Works Layout area Owerri. Counsel said it was therefore unbelievable and worrisome that the trial Court ignored all those pieces of evidence and express admission by the Respondents as well as the inconsistencies in the evidence of the Respondents, to resolve the issue of ownership of the land in Respondents’ favour. He said that the trial Court did so upon a faulty reasoning, that Appellant’s case was very weak; that being a misconception.  He relied on the case of Kasandubu & Anor Vs Ultimate Petroleum Ltd & Anor. 2008 FWLR Pt.417 155 at 167, to say that time for bringing an action begins to run in land cases, when possession is lost when cause of action accrued, save where there is fraudulent concealment of the facts of the time when such possession was lost or when the cause of action accrued. Counsel said, in this case, the Respondents fraudulently concealed the time the cause of action accrued. He, however, urged us to hold that the Suit was statute barred.  On Issue 3, Counsel said the refusal by the trial Court to give Appellant opportunity to reply to Respondents’ final address, on points of law, constituted a serious breach of Appellant’s constitutional rights to fair hearing. He relied on Section 36 of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria. He said that on 19213, Appellant closed his defence with the evidence of DW2 and the case was adjourned to 11313 for judgment, the Court calling on both parties to file and exchange addresses before that date; that Counsel on each side took 7 days to file and serve their address  Appellant’s Counsel filed on 26213, which was served on 27213; the Respondents filed theirs on 4313 but there was no proof of service of same on Appellant; he said that Appellant only noticed the Respondents’ address on 11313, minutes before the trial Judge started to read the judgment; that Appellant protested, insisting to be allowed to read the Respondents’ address, for possible reaction on points of law, but the trial Court refused the pleaprotest and would not place Appellant’s Counsel on record on the complaint. He said that the trial Court cannot shut out the Appellant’s protestobjection on 1132013 by refusing to take him and accord him the opportunity to be heard. He relied on the case of Tamiti Vs NSCB 2009 7 NWLR Pt.1141 631 and urged us to resolve the Issues for Appellant and allow the Appeal.  The Respondents’ Counsel, Ibeneme Njoku Esq, on Issue one, said that Appellant, from the onset, knew he had a weak case and so resorted [to] all legal chicanery and sharp practices at every stage of the trial. Counsel said the Writ of Summons and Statement of claim were served on the Appellant on 732007, but Appellant filed a motion on 752007 to set aside the service, and entered a conditional Appearance on 11607 Page 6 of the Records. Counsel said while Appellant was manipulating the Court in this way, he was at the same time accelerating his construction work on the land in dispute, so that at the end he could plead “completed act.” Counsel said that it was in pursuance of this Plan that Appellant, who was served personally with the originating process, denied being served and later filed the motion to set aside the service, saying that he was not served, despite being identified by a pointer Counsel who accompanied the Bailiff to the house where Appellant and his family lived.  Counsel said that the trial Judge acted rightly, when he allowed the renewal of the expired originating process, exercising his discretion, pursuant to Order 5 Rule 11 of the High Court Rules of Imo State, which states: “Where at any stage in the course of or in connection with any proceedings there has by reason of anything done or left undone, been a failure to comply with the requirements as to time, place, manner or form, the failure shall be treated as irregularity and may not nullify such step taken in the proceedings. The Judge may give any direction as he thinks fit to regularize such steps.”  Counsel further relied on the case of Kolawole vs Alberto  1989 1 NWLR Pt.98 382: “The factors which constitute good reasons on which the exercise of discretion to renew a Writ could be founded are many and may vary according to the circumstances of each case.”  The following may qualify as good reasons: a That the defendant is evading service; b That the delay was induced by the conduct of the defendant or his representative.  Counsel said the above case is on all fours with the present case; that Appellant evaded service of the originating process; denied that he was the person served with the process, and that caused the expiration of the Writ, which the Court later renewed.  On the use of ex-parte application to renew the Originating process, Counsel said that was in order, as the law permits that, where the interest of the Applicant alone is involved. He argued that when the life span of the Writ expired, there was no further contest between the parties and if the Respondents had not taken steps to make the case alive once more, the Suit would have abated and Appellant would have been happy. He said the Respondent was perfectly in order to come by way of ex-parte order to renew the Writ; that it is wrong for Appellants to say that issues were joined; he said that parties cannot join issues on a matter whose life span had expired and was no longer before the Court. He relied on7up Bottling Co. Vs Abiola & Sons Ltd 1989 4 NWLR Pt.114 229 at 237, to the effect that “ex-parte application means an application brought or made in the interest of one party to a Suit. Such an application may or may not directly affect the interest of the other party”.  Counsel therefore said that the trial Court was right to dismiss the Appellant’s application challenging renewal of the originating process, doing so in the exercise of its discretion. He noted that as at the time Appellant made the application, he was yet to settle his pleading after 4 years and was manipulating the time to build on the land. He relied on the case Odogwu Vs Odogwu 1992 2 NWLR Pt.225 539, to say that “the right to be heard does not in any way foreclose the exercise of discretion in favour or against the party heard.” He also relied on the case of Bakare Vs Lagos State Civil Service Commission & Anor 1992 8 NWLR Pt.262 641, to the effect that “It will be impossible to satisfy the requirement of fair hearing, when a party has made it impossible to reach him.”  That, he said, is the situation in this case, where Appellant, though served denied being served and that led to serving all future processes on him by substituted means.  On Issue 2, Counsel said the Respondents had been in possession of the land, unchallenged, since when they inherited it, together with other pieces of land from their forebears, until 2006, when Appellant trespassed on the land, and when challenged, resorted to threats and intimidation, using Police to arrest some of the Respondents.  On the issue of identity of the land, Counsel said there was no issue about that as both sides had identified the land in dispute; he said that identifying the land by different names does not affect its identity.  Counsel said that a trespasser cannot claim possession by a mere act of entry into land, and relied on Aromire Vs Awoyemi 1972 1 ALL NLR 101 at 103; Badru Vs Ozoh 1986 4 NWLR Pt. 38 724. He added that, one who asserts ownership, must prove same by credible evidence, and relied on Onwugbufor & Ors Vs Okoye & Ors 1996 34 LRCN; Piaro Vs Tenalo 1976 12 SC 41; Mogaji Vs Cadbury 1985 2 NWLR Pt.1 343. Counsel said the Respondents had established their root of title to the land, tracing same from their great grandfather, ELECHI, who deforested the land; he said that Appellant rather pleaded and asserted being given irrevocable power of Attorney to enter the land to build, but failed to call the Donor, Raymond Chindo Ndubuaku to give evidence on how he got the land to donate to Appellant. Counsel said that a party who produces an instrument of grant of land in proof of his title must go ahead to prove: 1 That the grantor had, in fact, what he purported to grant; 2 And the capacity and authority to make the grant; and 3 The grant had the effect claimed by the grantee, the holder of the title. He relied on Divine Ideas Vs Umoro 2007 ALL FWLR Pt.380  Counsel referred us to paragraphs 14 and 20 of the Appellants pleading, where he mentioned numerous people that he claimed witnessed the sale of the land in dispute to DW2 IroIwe, including Bernard Olua, said to have been a relation of Declan Amadi, who allegedly sold land that formed part of the land in dispute to IroIwe, but that Appellant failed to call the said witnesses to give evidence in support of the averment. He relied on the case of Bala Vs Bankole 1986 3 NWLR Pt.27 14. Specifically Counsel said that Appellant failed to call anybody from the family of Declan Amadi, from whom he claimed the root of title; Bernard Olua, who purportedly witnessed the sale transaction; Sylvester Ojiegbe from whom his donor purportedly acquired interest in the land; his donor and officials of the Ministry of lands Authority OCDA, touted in connection with the registration of the land and the charting of the same by Appellant. Counsel relied on The State Vs Azeez 2008 ALL FWLR Pt. 424 1423 on the need to call witness whose evidence can settle the issue in controversy.  Counsel added that pleadings do not constitute evidence; that they are mere notices, facts to found evidence -  Shell B.P. Petroleum Dev. Co. Vs Abedi & Ors 1974 1 SC 23; Ajuwon & Ors Vs Akanni & Ors 1993 12 SCNJ 23 at 50 - 51.  Counsel said it was ridiculous to say that Appellant demonstrated that his donor not only owned the land in dispute, but that he himself and the line of persons through whom the res got to him had been in effective possession of the re since 1975, whereas, it was common knowledge that, at the time DW2 allegedly bought his land from Declan Amadi in 1975, the whole area, now known as Works Layout, Owerri, consisted of farm lands and bush paths, but after the parcellation and plotting of the whole area, in 1978, by the Government of Imo State, the plot of land in dispute became plot 199 Works Layout, Owerri.  On the allegation that the Suit was statute barred, Counsel said that cannot be, as the Appellant trespassed on the land in 2006, and they took action to ward off the trespass in 2007. He relied on Elabanjo Vs Dawodu 2006 27 NSCQR; Ologunleko Vs Ikueomelo 1993 2 NWLR Pt.273 16; Udo Vs Effiom 2008 ALL FWLR Pt.414 1559.  Counsel added that acquisition of certificate of occupancy is no conclusive evidence of title, as one predicated on a defective title is a nullity and void, ab initio. He relied on Kyari Vs Alkali 2001 5 SC Pt. 2 192; Ogunleye Vs Oni 1990 2 NWLR Pt.135 745 SC; Udo Vs Effiom 2008 ALL FWLR Pt.414 1559.  On Issue 3, Counsel said that Appellant’s Counsel was served with the Respondent’s address; that he never made any complaint of non-service of the process at the date of the judgment; that the allegation of non-service of the Respondents’ address was only carried in the Appellant’s brief and is fraudulent, just as Appellant earlier fraudulently denied service of the originating process. He urged us to dismiss the allegation and to dismiss the entire appeal, for lacking in merit.  RESOLUTION OF THE ISSUES I shall consider this Appeal on the three Issues donated by the Appellant, taking them, serially.  Appellant had made a heavy weather of his Issue one, alleging a nullity of the entire trial, on the ground that the renewed originating process was a nullity as the trial Court had no competence to renew it by ex-parte Order, and after 3 years of expiration of the same Writ. The Respondents had argued that Appellant was served with the process but he denied service and fought to set the service on him aside which was done by the Court on 161010; he said that, upon the setting aside of the service of the originating process on the Appellant, the writ got expired by that time and needed to be renewed for service again on the Appellant. Counsel argued that while Appellant was manipulating the process contesting the service of the Writ on him he exploited that time of contesting service to build on the land in dispute!  The Respondents obtained an order, by ex-parte application to renew the writ on 22112010; they argued that the application was properly made and granted, ex-parte, because at that time the application affected only the Respondents Plaintiffs; that Appellant had no interest in the application; that it is wrong for Appellant to say that issues had been joined by the parties on the issue of renewal of the writ.  I tend to agree with the reasoning of the Respondents, that the application for renewal of the writ of summons could only have been done by an ex-parte application, because it was only the interest of the Respondents as Claimants that was to be determined by the application to renew the writ of summons. See 7up Bottling Co. Vs Abiola & Sons Ltd 1989 4 NWLR Pt.114 229 at 237. An application to renew an expired writ of summons is  process to give or restore life to a litigation process to originate a Suit and the Defendant Opponent has no interest in the process, until the same is given life and served on him Defendant. Thus, the defendant cannot talk of joining issues with a Plaintiff, who applies to renew or restore life to an expired originating process, in my opinion.  By Order 6 Rules 62 and 7 of the High Court Civil Procedure Rules of Imo State, 2008: “62 If a Judge is satisfied that it has proved impossible to serve an Originating process on any defendant within its life span and a claimant applies before its expiration for renewal of the process, the judge may renew the original or concurrent process for 3 months from the date of such renewal. 7 A judge may order renewals in each case strictly for good cause and upon prompt application, provided that no originating process shall be in force for longer than a total of 12 months. The Registrar shall state the fact, date and duration of renewal on every renewed originating process.” See Kolawole Vs Alberto 1989 1 NWLR Pt.98 382, where the Supreme Court held: “The factors which constitute good reasons on which the exercise of discretion to renew a Writ could be founded are many and may vary according to the circumstances of each case.”  The following may qualify as good reasons: c That the defendant is evading service; d That the delay was induced by the conduct of the defendant or his representative.  Appellant had argued that the trial Court had no power to renew the originating process, after 3 years of its issue on 22207, on the said 22112010, going by Order 6 Rule 7 of the Court Rules.  That argument, in my view, is unfortunate, in the circumstances of this case, and I think, to accede to it would amount to celebrating or promoting mischief, and malicious use of the Court process. Appellant had filed a conditional appearance in this Suit, on 1162007, and thereafter, used about three years to fight the service of the originating process on him, and while doing so, was building on the land, even with the knowledge of the pending law Suit. He succeeded in setting aside the service of the process on him, only on 161010.  I think the said writ remained alive and subsisting throughout the period of the contestation of the service of the process by the Appellant and that was why Appellant contested its service. To think or hold otherwise would mock or negate the whole essence of the struggle to set aside the service of the writ of summons on the Appellant! Thus, technically, in my view, the originating process only expired, when the trial Court pronounced that Appellant was not properly served with the process, and set aside the service on 16102010.  In that case of Kolawole Vs Alberto 1989 LPELR - 1700 SC, it was held: “service of a Writ of Summons made after the period of twelve months in respect of which a Defendant enters unconditional appearance is valid service - see Khawam Vs Elias 1960 5 F.S.C 244; The Gniezno 1967 2 ALL ER 738 at 745. If the Writ were void because of the expiration of its effectiveness, the service would not have been regarded as valid - See Sheldon Vs Brown Bayle ys Steel Work Ltd 1953 2 ALL ER 382. Order 5 Rule 6 did not intend that an expired writ be regarded as void.” Per Karibi-Whyte JSC.  It was further held: Where an act originally valid is rendered invalid by subsequent act, the invalibility arising thereby is temporary and is curable, in my view as a mere irregularity. This appears to be the position of this case. A writ of summons which has not been served for twelve months remains a valid writ of summons but lies dormant and ineffective for service, waiting to be reactivated and rendered efficacious in the manner prescribed by rules of Court - Per Karibi Whyte JSC. I think, the Respondent had promptly applied to renew the writ of summons, upon the order of 161010, setting said the service of same on the Appellant. And when the trial Court ordered the renewal of the said Originating process Writ of Summons on 22112010, the order breathed life into the said Writ of Summons and the subsequent service of the same on the Appellant by substituted means was proper, in the circumstances.  Of course, a renewed originating process, like an amended process, takes effect and dates back to when the original process was filed and so Appellant cannot talk about the Suit being statute barred. The Respondents had filed the Suit on 7207, upon alleging trespass on the land by Appellant in 2006. In that case of Kolawole Vs Alberto supra, the Supreme Court said: “The exercise of discretion is predicated on the consideration that, if the writ is not renewed and Plaintiff is compelled thereby to apply to issue another writ, his claim may be barred by the proof of the limitation law. See E. Ltd Vs C & Anor 1959 2 ALL ER 46; Small page Vs Tonge 17 Q.B.D. 644.” See Jatau Vs Ahmed & Ors 2003 LPELR - 1597 SC; Enigbokan Vs AIICO Nig. Ltd 1994 6 NWLR Pt.348 1 at 15 - 16; Ogwudire Vs Obigwe & Anor 2014 LPELR - 23635 CA.  Considering the conduct of the Appellant in contesting the service of the writ for about 3 years, before it was resolved, I would therefore resolve this issue against Appellant.  But I cannot also see how Appellant can successfully and validly raise and argue this Issue, founded on the interlocutory decision of the trial Court, reached on 2352011 which re-affirmed its decision renewing the originating process on 22112010, as he, Appellant failed to appeal against the said decision, when it was delivered; and he took part in the entire trial, until the final judgment on 2332013, and without formally filing notice of Appeal against the said interlocutory decision of 221110, andor seeking and obtaining the leave of this Court to raise appeal against the said ruling.  By law, Appellant, who failed to appeal against the said interlocutory decision, within 14 days of the decision, ought to have soughtobtained the leave of this Court to appeal against that decision, along with the Appeal against the final judgment. See Alaribe & Anor Vs Lawal & Ors 2019 LPELR - 47065 CA; and Ekemezie Vs Ifeanacho & Ors 2019 LPELR - 46518 SC, where it was held: “The said decision is accordingly interlocutory - this failure to obtain leave renders this appeal incompetent as this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain it - the net effect is that absence of the requisite leave of Court robs this Court of jurisdiction to hear this interlocutory appeal. I shall therefore enter an order striking out this appeal.” Nweze JSC. See Destra Investments Ltd Vs FRN & Anor 2018 LPELR - 43883 SC: “The Lower Court was right when it found that the decision of the trial Court is a discretionary one and an appeal querying an interlocutory decision on exercise of discretion must be by leave which was not sought before it was filed, notwithstanding the fact that it took the point suo motu without inviting counsel to address it on the point, the appeal is incompetent and liable to be struck out.” The above, in my opinion, should be the fate of this Issue, founded on grounds 1 - 3 of the Appeal, which Appellant said are against the interlocutory decision of 2352011. There is no indication that he Appellant sought andor obtained the leave of this Court to argue the said issue, based on the interlocutory decision. The said Issue and grounds 1 - 3 of the Appeal are therefore incompetent and are hereby struck out.  On Issue 2, whether the final judgment of 1132013 was not against the weight of evidence and that the trial Court did not consider or ignored documentary evidence like the chart obtained from the lands Registry - Exhibit 7 etc, I hasten to answer this in the negative, as I think, the trial Court had duly considered the evidence placed before it.  Appellant had argued in paragraph 4.17 and 4.18 of the brief that: “the combined effect of the exhibits, Appellant’s pleadings witness deposition and testimony in Court, put to rest the question as to who owned the land in dispute - plot 199 Works Layout, Owerri; that those pieces of materials clearly traced the Appellant’s Donors title to Sylvester Ojiegbe, to Cornelius IroIwe, DW2, to the original native owner of the land, Declan Amadi of Umuimeka Orji who, the claimants admitted owned the expanse of land in the Works Layout area, Owerri, where the land in dispute situate, and sold to DW2.  But that the trial Court, surprisingly, ignored all those pieces of material evidence and express admissions of Respondents and gave judgment to Respondents, on the ground that Appellant failed to produce some vital witnesses to testify for him and that Respondents, being indigenous to the area of the land in dispute, were in a position to know who owned the land in the area, and their land.  Of course, the Respondents had argued that the trial Court had made proper evaluation and findings, and had reached the correct conclusion, when it held for them Respondents. Counsel said it was ridiculous to claim that “Appellant demonstrated that his donor, not only owned the land in dispute but that he himself and the line of persons through whom the res got to him, had been in effective possession of the res since 1975”,  when apart from DW2 IroIwe, none of the persons, who either witnessed the land transaction or were in the line of the persons through whom Appellant got the res, was called to give evidence; that they Respondents were in possession of the land until 2006, when Appellant trespassed thereon; Counsel said that they inherited the land from their forebear Elechi who deforested the land; that the entire land in the area, as at 1975, was a farm land until the government of Imo State picked interest in it in 1998 and demarcated or parceled the expanse of land into a Layout and Plots, with the land in dispute, becoming Plot 199. They argued that Raymond Chindo Ndubuaka who allegedly donated the land to Appellant, was not called to say how he got the land, and that DW2, who allegedly bought the land in dispute, did not call any of the persons who allegedly witnessed the sale, including Bernard Olua, who was said to be alive, nor any relation of the alleged seller, Declan Amadi, nor Sylvester Ojiegbe from whom the Appellant’s donor Raymond Chindo Ndubuaku purportedly acquired the land!  Counsel submitted that brandishing documents of title of land, like certificate of occupancy C. of .O and Power of Attorney, is of no use, where the party who produces the document cannot establish his root of title, backed by the instrument, produced. He relied on Divine Ideas Vs Umoru 2007 ALL FWLR Pt.380.  Of course, the law is trite, that mere production of document of title to land, is not conclusive proof of title, where the source of the title document or authority to issue same, is wanting in legitimacy. The Court is expected to scrutinize and evaluate the said document of title, to determine whether: a The document is genuine and valid b It was duly executed, stamped and registered c The grantor had the authority and capacity to make the grant d The grantor, in fact, had what he purported to grant and e The document has the effect claimed by the holder of the document. See Apampa & Ors Vs Ogungbemi 2017 LPELR - 43264 CA; Akinduro Vs Alaya 2007 6 SC Pt.2 120; Kyari Vs Alkali 2001 11 NWLR Pt.724 412; Romaine Vs Romaine 1992 4 NWLR Pt.2380 650; Oyeneyin Vs Akinkugbe 2010 4 NWLR Pt.1184 265; and Francis Adesina Ayanwale Vs O.O. Odusami 2011 LPELR - 8143 SC; Korie Vs Ifenkwe 2018 LPELR - 44987 CA.  In this case, the trial Court had found that the evidence of Respondents was satisfactory, in the tracing of their title to the land in dispute; and that Appellant’s evidence was wanting, especially as the DW2’s evidence of purchase of the lands in the area including the land in dispute from Declan Amadi, was not substantiated particularly as Bernard Olua, who allegedly witnessed the sale, was not called to testify even when he was said to be alive to show that what DW2 bought, from Declan Amadi, included the land in dispute - plot 199 Works Layout, Owerri.  Appellant did not also call evidence of the officials from the land Registry and or Owerri Capital Development Authority, on the charting of the Plots of the lands in their Exhibit 7, and the ownership of same, and I think, it was his Appellant’s duty to call such evidence, not the Respondents’ duty. I resolve the Issue against the Appellant, as I cannot see how I can fault the decision of the trial Court, that the Respondents had established their claim.  On Issue 3, whether the trial Court breached Appellant’s right to fair hearing, by acting on Respondents’ Address, without allowing Appellant opportunity to file a Reply on points of law and ignoring Appellant’s protest on the issue, on the date of judgment. I think, Appellant himself anticipated the futility of this issue which is not covered by the Records of Appeal, when his Counsel alleged in what appears as blackmailing the trial Court that he only saw Respondents’ address on the date of the judgment, and he raised protest against it, and sought to be allowed to read the Address for possible reaction on points of law, before the judgment, but the Court refusedor ignored him, and would not record his protest!  The Respondents’ Counsel had denied the above allegations and had asserted that Appellant had been served with their address and that there was no such protest at the time of reading the judgment; that Appellant was only acting his usual mischief, by alleging such blackmail against the trial Judge.  There is nothing in the Records of Appeal to support Appellant’s claims that he was not served with Respondents’ address and that he protested and sought to be allowed to react to the Respondents’ address which he allegedly saw on the date of judgment and was refused, thereby violating his right of fair hearing! Normally, both the appellate Court and the parties are bound by the Records of Appeal in any matterquestion or issue that touches on the Appeal. This strange complaint of Appellant, on this issue, is outside the catchment of the Records of Appeal and appears to be wishful thinking of Appellant andor some mischief, to discredit the judgment. See Abaribe vs Nkwonta & Ors 2015 LPELR - 25701 CA: “The parties and appellate Court are bound by the records of appeal on any issue in controversy, and cannot go outside the clear facts on the records to speculate on any issue” Orok Vs Orok 2013 LPELR - 20377; Garuba Vs Omokhodion 2011 15 NWLR Pt.1269 145 at 180.” See also Audu Vs FRN 2013 LPELR - 19897 SC; Sommer Vs FHA 1992 1 NWLR Pt.219 548; Texaco Panama Inc. of Nig. Ltd Vs S.P.D.C. Nig. Ltd 2002 5 NWLR Pt.759 209 to the effect that the Court is not only bound by the records of appeal, but is also bound to examine the state of the record on the conflicting claims of the parties.  The said Issue 3, in my view, was contrived to blackmail the trial Court. It is incompetent and is struck out.  On the whole, I resolve the Issues against Appellant and dismiss the Appeal for lacking in merit. I award cost of N50,000 Fifty Thousand Naira against Appellant, to the Respondents.   RAPHAEL CHIKWE AGBO, J.C.A.:  I agree.   IBRAHIM ALI ANDENYANGTSO, J.C.A.:  Having had the privilege of reading the judgment just delivered my learned Noble Lord I. G. MBABA JCA, I agree with his reasoning and conclusions that this Appeal lacks merit and deserves to be dismissed.  I accordingly dismiss same and abide by the ancillary orders made in the lead judgment as to cost.-end!" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  PAUL ADAMU GALUMJE, J.S.C. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  The Appellant herein as plaintiff at the Federal High Court Owerri took out an originating summons in which he raised three questions for determination as follows: - 1. Whether having regard to the provision of the Section 871 and 2 of the Electoral Act of 2010 as amended, the 1st Defendant can appoint, impose or select the 2nd Defendant as the governorship candidate of the 1st Defendant in Imo State, when the 2nd Defendant did not participate in the Primary election for the selection of the governorship candidate of the 1st Defendant. 2. Whether having regards to Section 874b of the Electoral Act 2010 as amended, the 1st Defendant is not under a legal obligation to submit the name of the plaintiff who emerged winner of the primary election to the 3rd Defendant as the 1st Defendant's governorship candidate in Imo State for the 2019 general elections. 3. Whether the 2nd Defendant who did not participate in the primary election for the selection of the 1st Defendant’s governorship candidate in Imo State for the 2019 general election has his name submitted to the 3rd Defendant as the 1st Defendant's governorship candidate for the said election under any circumstance or guise or whatsoever.  Thereafter, the Appellant claimed the following reliefs: - 1. A declaration that the 2nd Defendant having not participated in the primary election for the selection of governorship candidate of the 1st Defendant for the 2019 general election cannot have his name submitted to the 3rd Defendant as the 1st Defendant's governorship candidate for the said election. 2. A declaration that any purported selection, nomination of the 2nd Defendant as the governorship candidate of the 1st Defendant for the 2019 general election is illegal, invalid, null, void and of no effect. 3. An order of this honorable Court setting aside any purported selection or nomination of the 2nd Defendant by the 1st Defendant as its governorship candidate for the 2019 General Election. 4. An order of this honorable Court mandating the 1st defendant to submit the name of the plaintiff as its governorship candidate for the 2019 General Election. 5. An order of this honourable Court restraining the 3rd Defendant from accepting the name of the 2nd Defendant as the 1st Defendant's governorship candidate for the 2019 General Election for non-compliance with the Electoral Act 2010 as amended. 6. An order of this honourable Court restraining the 1st Defendant from submitting the 2nd Defendant's name as the governorship candidate for the 2019 General Election.  This originating summons is accompanied by an affidavit of nineteen paragraphs deposed to by Emeka Chris Ewuzie, a Director in the campaign office of the Appellant herein. Annexed to the supporting affidavit are copies of the Appellant's membership card, expression of interest form and nomination form, marked as Exhibit A, B and C respectively. Respondents filed various preliminary objection to the competence of the originating summons. These preliminary objections were overruled. On the merit of the case, the Trial Court granted all the reliefs claimed by the Appellant, who was adjudged the winner of the 2nd Respondent's Governorship primary election which was held on the 5th and 6th October, 2018. The 2nd Respondent was aggrieved with the decision of the trial Court and it therefore appealed to the Court of Appeal, Owerri Division the lower Court and submitted three issues for determination of its appeal. The Appeal was heard and in a reserved and considered judgment, delivered on the 4th day of May 2019, the lower Court vacated the judgment of the trial Court on the ground that it did not meet the standard of adjudication expected in our adversarial system of adjudication. The lower Court did not remit the case to the Federal High Court, but ordered the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court to transfer the case to another Judge to be heard and determined de novo.  The Appellant herein is dissatisfied with the decision of the lower Court. Being aggrieved he has brought this appeal. His notice of appeal filed on the 17th of May, 2019 contains three grounds of appeal.  Parties filed and exchanged briefs of argument. Mr. Chukwudi Adiukwu, Learned Counsel for the Appellant, settled the Appellants brief of argument which was filed on the 10th June, 2019. At page 5 of the Appellant's brief of argument, two issues have been formulated for determination of this appeal. They read as follows: - i Whether the appeal had not become academic if so; whether the lower Court was right to make an order of trial de novo given the provisions of Section 285 of the 1999 Constitution As amended by the 4th Alteration. ii Whether the lower Court was right to hold that the parties right to address the Court was trampled upon and hence a breach of fair hearing.  Mr. R. A. Lawal- Rabana, Learned Senior Counsel for the 1st Respondent, who settled the 1st Respondent's brief of argument submitted three issues for determination of this appeal in the following terms: - i. \"Was the lower Court right when it held that the 1st Respondent's Appeal was not an academic exercise? ii. Was it proper for the lower Court to order the hearing de-novo of the suit by another Judge in the trial Court in view of Section 285 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended? ii. Was the lower Court right to hold that the 1st Respondent's right to fair hearing had been breached by the trial Court?\"  After having set out the issues for determination of this appeal, Learned Senior Counsel issued what he termed \"objectionpreliminaries.\" Underneath the \"objectionpreliminaries\" he inserted the following words, \"INCOMPETENCE OF THE RECORDS OF APPEAL.\" However, at the hearing of this appeal, this objectionpreliminary was withdrawn and same was struck out. Mr. A.I Nwachukwu, Learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent, who settled the 2nd Respondent's brief of argument also formulated three issues for determination of this appeal as follows: - 1. Whether the Court below was not right in holding that the appeal before it was not academic. 2. Whether the Court below was not right in holding that the 1st Respondent herein was denied the right of fair hearing by the Trial High Court. 3. Whether the Court below was not right in ordering the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court to transfer the case to another Judge for hearing and determination de novo.  By formulating three issues each, the 1st and 2nd Respondents seem to be crying more than the bereaved. The Appellant, who is aggrieved by the decision of the lower Court issued only two issues for determination of this appeal.  Although the Respondents are entitled to either adopt the issues formulated by the Appellant, give the issues a slant in favour of his own side of his case or formulate his own issues derivable from the grounds of appeal, it is always desirable that the Respondent should not formulate more issues than the Appellant. See Kajawa v. State 2018 LPELR-43911 SC. In this appeal, I am of the view that the two issues submitted by the Appellant have covered the field. I will adopt them in determination of this appeal.  This is a pre-election matter which was filed at the Federal High Court Owerri on the 24th October, 2018. By Section 28510 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, the Federal High Court was mandatorily required to deliver its judgment within 180 days from the date of filing the suit. The lower Court's judgment was delivered on the 4th of May, 2019. At the time the lower Court's judgment was delivered, the trial Court no longer had jurisdiction to hear and determine this case, since the Constitutional period available for it to hear and determine pre-election matter had lapsed. From the date the petition was filed at the Federal High Court and the date the lower Court delivered its judgment was precisely 192 days. Clearly the lower Court's order for retrial was made in error, since the trial Court no longer had jurisdiction to hear and determine this case.  On whether a pre-election matter is academic or not, is dependent on the facts giving rise to the pre-election matter. For example, where a party from which the pre-election matter is being contested wins the general election, such pre-election suit can never be an academic exercise. In Plateau State v A. G. Federation 2006 3 NWLR Pt.967346 this Court stated as follows: - “A suit is academic where it is thereby theoretical, makes empty sound and of no practical utilitarian value to the plaintiffs even if judgment is given in his favour. A suit is academic if it is not related to practical situation of human nature and humanity.\" See Odedo v. INEC 2008 17 NWLR Pt.1117554. Once a suit no longer has live issues for determination, such a suit is academic and a Court should on no account spend judicial time, or engage in academic exercise. Courts are to determine live issues. See Oyeneye v. Odugbesan 1972 4 5C.244; Bakare v. A.C.B. Ltd 1986 3 NWLR Pt.26 137; Okulate v. Awosanya 2002 2 NWLR Pt.645 530; Nkwocha v. Gov. of Anambra State 1984 1 SCNLR 634.  In the instant case, the general election was held and none of the candidate of the 2nd Respondent or any of the parties to this appeal was declared the winner of the Governorship election in Imo State. There is also no evidence that any of the parties to this appeal is challenging the election of the winner of the 2019 general election in any Court. Even if any of the party in this suit is declared the winner of the Governorship Primary election of the 2nd Respondent, of what use is the decision to the winner. This is what is described as academic exercise. I am therefore of the firm view that this appeal has clearly become an academic exercise and this Court cannot waste its precious time attending to it. The first issue for determination is accordingly resolved in favour of the Appellant.  This appeal being an academic exercise is hereby struck out. I make no order as to costs.  Parties had agreed before the hearing of this appeal that the decision in SC.6272019, Dr. Casmir Anyanwu v. Social Democratic Party & Ors. shall abide the decision in this appeal.  I endorse their agreement.   MARY UKAEGO PETER-ODILI, J.S.C.:  I am at one with the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Paul Adamu Galumje and to show the support on record, I shall make some remarks.  This is an appeal by the 1st respondent in the Court below against the decision of the Court of Appeal, Owerri Division, Coram: Raphael C. Agbo, Theresa Ngolika Orij-Abadua, Ibrahim Ali Andeyantso JJCA in which decision the Court of Appeal or Court below or Lower allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Federal High Court and ordered a retrial.  INTRODUCTION OF THE FACTS: By Originating Summons, the Appellant herein as Plaintiff at the Federal High Court brought an action against the Respondents as Defendants claiming the following reliefs: - \"a A declaration that the 2nd defendant having not participated in the primary election for the selection of governorship candidate of the 1st defendant for the 2019 general election cannot have his name submitted to the 3rd defendant as the 1st defendant's governorship candidate. b A declaration that any purported selection nomination of the 2nd defendant as the governorship candidate of the 1st defendant for the 2019 general election is illegal, invalid, null and void and of no effect. c An order of this Court setting aside any purported selection or nomination of the 2nd defendant by the 1st defendant as its governorship candidate for the 2019 general election. d An order of this Court mandating the 1st defendant to submit the name of the plaintiff as its governorship candidate for the 2019 general election. e An order of this Honourable Court restraining the 3rd defendant from accepting the name of the 2nd defendant as the 1st defendant's governorship candidate for the 2019 general election for non-compliance with the Electoral Act 2019. f An order of the honourable Court restraining the 1st defendant from submitting the 2nd defendant's name as the governorship candidate for the 2019 General Election\".  At the hearing on 4th July 2019, learned counsel for the appellant, Chukwudi Adiukwu Esq. adopted the brief of argument filed on 10619 in which were framed two issues for determination which are thus:- 1. Whether the appeal had not become academic if so, whether the Lower Court was right to make an order of trial de novo given the provisions of Section 285 of the 1999 Constitution as amended by the 4th Alteration. Grounds one and two. 2. Whether the Lower Court was right to hold that the parties rights to address the Court was trampled upon and hence a breach of fair hearing. Ground three.  Learned counsel for the 1st respondent, Ikechukwu Uwana adopted the brief of argument settled by R. A. Lawal - Rabana SAN and filed on 20619 in which he distilled three issues for determination which are as follows:- i Was the Lower Court right when it held that the 1st respondent's appeal was not an academic exercise? Distilled from ground one of the notice of appeal. ii Was it proper for the Lower Court to order the hearing de novo of the suit by another judge in the trial Court in view of Section 285 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended? Distilled from ground two of the notice of appeal. iii Was the Lower Court right to hold that the 1st Respondent's right to fair hearing had been reached by the trial Court? Distilled from ground 3 of the notice of appeal.  For the 2nd respondent, learned counsel, A.I. Nwachukwu Esq. adopted the brief of argument filed on 2762019 in which were formulated three issues for determination, viz:- a. Whether the Court below was not right in holding that the appeal before it was not academic. This is formulated from Ground One of the Grounds of Appeal. b. Whether the Court below was not right in holding that the 1st respondent herein was denied of a fair hearing by the trial Federal High Court. This is formulated from Ground Three of the Grounds of Appeal. c. Whether the Court below was not right in ordering the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court to transfer the case to another Judge for hearing and determination de novo. This is formulated from Ground Two of the Grounds of Appeal.  For ease of reference, I shall make use of the issues as crafted by the appellant in the determination of this appeal. i Whether the appeal had not become academic if so; whether the lower Court was right to make an order of trial de novo given the provisions of Section 285 of the 1999 Constitution as amended 4th Alteration. Grounds One and Two. ii Whether the lower Court was right to hold that the parties rights to address the Court was trampled upon and hence a breach of fair hearing. Ground Three  Learned counsel for the appellant stated that Section 28513 of the 1999 Constitution as amended which would be referred to as CFRN for short, that it is not capable of any other interpretation and therefore should be given its literary and ordinary meaning with the effect that the appeal is now spent and so the order of the Lower Court for a trial de novo for a matter already spent is in vain. He referred to Section 285 10 CFRN; Coca Cola Nig. Ltd v Akinsanya 2017 17 NWLR Pt.1593 74 at 121.  It was further canvassed for the appellant that there was no breach of fair hearing at the Lower Court or Court of first instance which makes the order for retrial at the High Court perverse. It was relied on the case of Kolo v COP 2017 LPELR - 42577 Pp 45 - 46; Newswatch Communications Ltd v Attah 2006 12 NWLR Pt.993 144 at 171.  For the 1st respondent, it was contended that a pre-election matter does not become academic merely because election has taken place as election matters are sui generis. He cited Hassan v Aliyu & ors 2010 LPELR - L357 SC; Charles Chikwendu Odedo v INEC & Anor. 2008 LPELR. 2204 SC; Senator Umaru Dahiru & Anor. v All Progressives Congress & Ors.2016 LPELR - 42089 SC..  That the Court below was within its jurisdiction to order the retrial at the Court of first instance and the 180 days would begin to run in the light of the finding by the Court below that some documents had been fraudulently tampered with at the trial Court hence the lack of fair hearing as that Court did not address the issue. He cited FRN v Mohammed 2014 9 NWLR Pt.1413 551 at 593 - 594 etc.  Learned counsel for the 2nd respondent submitted that the Court below was right in holding that the appeal before it was not academic. He cited Plateau state of Nigeria v Attorney General of the Federation 2006 All FWLR Pt.305 590 at 646-647.  That the order for trial de novo made by the Court of Appeal was correct in the light of the obvious breach of fair hearing at that Court of first instance.  The 3rd respondent was absent though properly served with the hearing notice as shown in the Affidavit of service of 27619. It filed no brief.  The angle taken by the appellant is that the order of the Court of Appeal for a retrial at the High Court is not supportable as the 180 days within which such a trial would be incepted and concluded had long passed. Also that the denial of fair hearing alleged by the respondents cannot be sustained either as the parties failed to take advantage of the judicial instruments available to ventilate their grouse and so had waived their right.  The respondents 1st and 2nd on the other hand posit that the Court below had not acted on an academic exercise and had correctly found that the 1st respondent's right to fair hearing had been breached.  It is true and now very well settled that the Court including the Supreme Court does not embark on an academic exercise and the reason for it is glaring in the sight of all well thinking persons. A suit is defined as academic when it is merely theoretical, makes an empty sound and has no practical utilitarian value to the plaintiff or claimant if the judgment ensures in his favour. Again, a suit is academic if it is not related to the practical situations of human nature and humanity. The converse is thus, that a suit does not become academic just because what brought about the action had been concluded. See Plateau State of Nigeria v Attorney General of the Federation 2006 All FWLR Pt.305 590 at 646 - 647; Senator Umaru Dahiru & Anor. v All Progressives Congress & Ors. 2016 LPELR - 42089 SC.  Taken in context, in this appeal, the Court of Appeal found that there was a denial of fair hearing to the 1st respondent and the other parties by not taking any address from them after voiding the written Address in support of the originating Summons and without the said address the trial Court proceeded to resolve the issues formulated for determination in the originating summons. That was the basis upon which the Court below vacated the judgment of the trial Court and ordered a transfer of the case to another judge for hearing and determination de novo in the light of the breach of fair hearing which was duly established at the Court below. The stance of the appellant is that with the general election having been conducted, concluded, a winner emerged and has taken the oath of office as Governor and operating as such, this matter is not to be gone into since it presents the picture of an academic exercise. That posture is not sustainable as a pre-election matter such as the one that brought this appeal does not become academic or hypothetical merely because the general election had taken place and on the face of it the pre-election over-taken by events. The correct position is that the pre-election is well within the relevant statutes and time prescribed remains a live issue inspite of the general election that had been concluded. See Odedo v INEC 2009 All FWLR Pt.449 448 at 488-489 per Tobi JSC; Adeogun v Fashogbon 2009 All FWLR Pt.449 531 at 546-547 per Tabai JSC; Gwede v INEC 2015 All FWLR Pt.767 615 at 656; Agboola v UBA Plc 2012 All FWLR Pt.574 74 at 103; Ladoja v Ajimobi 2016 All FWLR Pt.843 1846 at 1884; Ngige v Obi 2006 All FWLR Pt'330 1041; Aiyeola v Pedro 2014 All FWLR Pt.744 14.  The fundamental structure of the principle of fair hearing and as enshrined in Section 36 of the 1999 Constitution is such that its breach could not have been ignored by the Court below which was within its powers guaranteed in Section 285 12 of the same Constitution and so had to go into the alleged infringement and the records showed quite clearly that an infraction of fair hearing was grossly made. The allegation of the breach of fair hearing was not lightly made nor brought up unadvisedly or just to whip up a distraction and therefore different from what brought about the admonition of this Court inKolo v COP 2017 LPELR - 42577 SC per Nweze JSC; Newswatch Communications Ltd v Attah 2006 12 NWLR Pt,993 L44 at 171 Per Tobi JSC.  The situation as I said herein is opposite what the Supreme Court found in the cases above cited as in this instance the Lower Court rightly found that documents had been fraudulently tampered with thereby rendering the documents and records unreliable which facts were brought out in the further and better affidavit of 1st respondent and also the issue of the non-signing of the 1st respondent’s Notice of preliminary objection which the trial Court left unattended. It is trite that a Court has a duty to consider all evidence and arguments placed before it before reaching a decision and it was the failure of that trial Court's lack of consideration of the evidence and argument of the 1st respondent properly placed before it, before reaching the decision that amounted to the violation of the party's fair hearing and the resultant effect is that the decision so reached cannot stand as it is a nullity. See Cookey v Fombo 2005 5 SC 11 102 at 111; FRN v Mohammed 2014 9 NWLR Pt.1413 551 at 593-594; Audu v FRN 2013 LPELR-19897; Akinfe v The State 1988 3 NWLR Pt.85 729 at 753; Bamgboye v University of Ilorin 1999 10 NWLR Pt.672 290 at 333; Offor v State 199912 NWLR Pt,623 609 at 623; Salu v Egeibon 1994 6 NWLR Pt.348 23.  The situation therefore clearly shows that the Court of Appeal acted rightly in declaring that the matter before it was not academic and was well endowed with jurisdictional powers to entertain the appeal as the Court below was well within its 60 days to hear and determine the appeal. That the Lower Court did and rightly found that there had been a breach of fair hearing at the trial Court and it is the next step that created a puzzle with the lower Court ordering a trial de novo at the Court of first instance albeit by another judge.  The opposing views on this order for retrial is, firstly put forward by the appellant that the 180 days for trial and judgment at the Court of first instance having been exhausted, the order for retrial is one in vain. The opposing stance is that the 180 days would start to run from the time of the starting of the new trial. To take a position either way of the contending postures stated above is to first have a recourse of Section 285 10 of the 1999 Constitution as amended 4th alteration which provides thus: \"A Court in every pre-election matter shall deliver its judgment in writing within 180 days from the date of filing of the suit\".  The action in this instance was filed at the High Court on 24th October, 2018 which lapsed on 21st April, 2019 and the judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered on 4th May, 2019 by which time, the 180 days of the trial Court had expired. The immediate reaction is that the order for trial de novo at the Court of first instance cannot be implemented in the face of the expiration of the time allowed it to entertain the trial from filing to judgment.   What cannot be denied is the Court of Appeal's right is well within the 60 days granted it by the Constitutional provisions of Section 285 12 to consider all the issues before it on appeal which it did and making the finding that the fair hearing rights of the 1st respondent had been breached set aside the judgment of the trial Court. That being so, the decision and reliefs which had been given by the trial Court to the appellant remain vacated. The further order for retrial as I said earlier is an order that has been overtaken by event, simply the expiration of the 180 days for trial at first instance and so would take the status of a muted trumpet.  Finally, this appeal has no merit and is dismissed based on the foregoing and the better reasoned lead judgment.   OLUKAYODE ARIWOOLA, J.S.C.:  I had the opportunity of reading in draft the lead judgment of my learned brother Galumje, JSC just delivered. I agree entirely with the reasoning and conclusion that the appeal is unmeritorious and should be struck out. I too will strike out the appeal.  Appeal struck out.   AMIRU SANUSI, J.S.C.:  The leading judgment prepared by my learned brother Galumje, JSC was supplied to me before now. Having perused same, I find myself at one with his reasoning and the conclusion he reached by striking out the appeal.  There is no mincing words and it is even supported by the record of appeal that the Federal High Court delivered its judgment on 24th October, 2018. By the provisions of Section 285 10 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended, judgments should be delivered within 180 days from the date the suit was filed before it. On its part, the lower Court delivered its judgment on 4th May, 2019. In its judgment, the lower Court made an order of retrial of the suit by the trial Court. As at the time the lower Court delivered its judgment now being appealed against ordering the retrial of the suit by the trial Court on 4th May, 2019, the 180 days provided by Section 285 10 as period for trial and determination of the suit had already elapsed as it would be more than 190 days. To my mind, Courts are not supposed to make order which could be in vain or impracticable to be obeyed or which will simply amount to academic exercise. In the case of Odedo v INEC 200817 NWLR pt.117 554 this Court while referring to the case of Plateau State v AG Federation 2006 3 NWLR pt.967 346 Niki Tobi,JSC of blessed memory defined academic suit to mean “a suit which is merely theoretical, makes empty sound and of no practical utilitarian even if judgment is given in his favour. A suit is academic if it is not related to the practical situation of human nature and humanity.” See Congress for Progressive Change Vs INEC 2011 LPELR-8257 SC.  It is my considered view therefore, that even if the mattersuit were to be remitted to the trial Court for trial de novo, it will be met with the challenge of effluxion of the 180 days period and the trial Court would be bereft of jurisdiction to hear and determine it. It would therefore be hypothetical or a moot exercise.  Thus, in the result, the suit in my view is really an academic exercise which will serve none of the parties any useful purpose. As a corollary, the appeal deserves to be struck out and I accordingly do same. I make no order on costs so each party shall bear his or its respective costs.   UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI, J.S.C.:  The Appellant vide originating summons came before the Federal High Court, Owerri, to seek for reliefs bordering on the Governorship primary election organized and conducted by the 2nd Respondent wherein all the reliefs sought by the Appellant were granted him by the trial Court, having adjudged him as the winner of the said primary election held on 5-6102018. On appeal by the 2nd Respondent, the lower Court in vacating the judgment of the trial Court, ordered for a trial de novo before another judge instead of remitting the matter to the trial Court. Aggrieved, the Appellant brought up the matter to this Court and distilled the following as issues for determination: 1. Whether the appeal had not become academic, if so, whether the lower Court was right to make an order of trial de novo given the provisions of Section 285 of the 1999 Constitution as amended by the 4th Alteration. 2. Whether the lower Court was right to hold that the parties' right to address the Court was trampled upon and hence a breach of fair hearing.  It must be noted that the Appellant filled this pre-election matter at the Federal High Court on 24102018, and the judgment of the lower Court ordering a trial de novo was delivered on 452019. Thus, from the date the pre-election matter was filed to the date the lower Court delivered its judgment, 192 days were spent already. By virtue of Section 28510 of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria, the matter was caught up with the statute of limitation providing for 180 days within which the Federal High Court was to deliver its judgment from the date of filing the matter. The trial Court therefore does not have the jurisdiction to hear the suit de novo since its statutory time to entertain same has elapsed. To continue with the hearing de novo will be an exercise in futility and therefore academic and the duty of the Court is to determine live issues only. It has no business delving into academic or hypothetical issues. Judicial time is too precious for such an exercise. See Per KEKERE-EKUN, JSC in LAWSON v. OKORONKWO & ORS 2018 LPELR-46356SC. This matter appealed against is dead and this Court is not permitted to delve into it or resuscitate it, having become hypothetical.  This appeal therefore lacks merit and is dismissed. I entirely agree with the decision of my learned brother, Galumje, JSC, in dismissing the appeal.-end!" ;

After the SDP’s nomination primary for the 2019 Gubernatorial elections in 2018, the Appellant as Plaintiff claimed, via an originating summons before a High Court, for several reliefs including two declarations, to wit: that the 2nd Defendant having not participated in the primary election of SDP’ for the 2019 general election cannot have his name submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC as SDP’s governorship candidate for the general election and therefore any purported selection, nomination of the 2nd Defendant as the governorship candidate of their Party for the 2019 general election was illegal, invalid, null, void and of no effect. Appellant/Plaintiff also sought several orders from the Court including an order mandating the Party INEC to submit the name of the plaintiff as the governorship candidate of the Party for the 2019 General Election. The Respondents filed various preliminary objections as to the competence of the originating summons which were overruled.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  EMMANUEL AKOMAYE AGIM, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  This appeal No. CAA3232015 was commenced on 8122014 when the appellant filed a notice of appeal against the judgment of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory in suit No: FCTHCCV932011, delivered on 2992014 by Olukayode A. Adeniyi J. The notice of appeal contains 2 grounds of appeal.  By a notice filed on 10012019, the appellant withdrew the appeal against the 2nd respondent, Jude Eze.  Both sides filed, exchanged and adopted their respective briefs as follows- appellant’s brief and 1st respondent’s brief.  The appellant’s brief raised the following issues for determination- 1. Was the learned trial Judge right to hold that the 1st Respondent was not vicariously liable for the acts of the 2nd defendant who was its servant in its employment when he carried out the alleged acts in the course of his official duty Distilled from Ground 1. 2. Was the learned trial Judge right to excuse the 1st Respondent from liability on the basis of Exhibit D1 when contract of employment Clause 16 and 11 IX relied upon merely advised and warned its employees from engaging in fight and molesting passengers without clearly excusingabsolving the company from liability in event of contravention Distilled from Ground 2.  The 1st respondent’s brief restated and thereby adopted the above issues raised for determination in the appellant’s brief.  I will determine this appeal on the basis of the said issues raised for determination in the appellant’s brief.  The part of the judgment of the trial Court complained against in this appeal reads thusly-  This now leads me to the determination of the second issue under consideration, as to whether or not the 1st Defendant is vicariously liable for the assault and battery committed by the 2nd Defendant against the Plaintiff. The general principle of law with respect to vicarious liability is that once a master employs a servant to do something for him, he is responsible for the servant’s conduct as if it were his own. If the servant commits a tort in the course of his employment, then, the master is a tortfeasor as well as the servant. The master is answerable for every wrong of the servant once it is shown to have been committed in the course of his employment. In such a circumstance, since the servant and the master are viewed in law as joint tortfeasors, a plaintiff is at liberty to choose his victim. He may decide to sue either of the master and servant separately, or both of them jointly. See the Supreme Court decision in Ifeanyi Chukwu Osondu Limited Vs. Solel Boneh Limited 2000 5 NWLR Pt. 656 322 also reported in [2000] FWLR Pt. 27 2046]; SPDC Nigeria Plc. Vs. Dino [2007] 2 NWLR Pt. 1019 438. As I have already found and held in the foregoing, parties are not in dispute that the 2nd Defendant drove the 1st Defendant’s bus in the course of his employment with the 1st Defendant on the dates in question. It is also established that the assault and battery incident was perpetrated by the 2nd Defendant against the Plaintiff inside the said bus that belonged to the 1st Defendant, whilst the 2nd Defendant was driving the same from Abuja to Lagos on the dates in question, in the course of his employment. To further establish that the 2nd Defendant was an employee of the 1st Defendant at the material period, the 1st Defendant of her own volition tendered in evidence as Exhibit D1, the 2nd Defendant’s contract of employment with the 1st Defendant, which was executed between the two parties on 10012008. The DW1 further testified that the 2nd Defendant left the employment of the 1st Defendant on 01092011, after the incident in issue. However, learned 1st Defendant’s Counsel had contended that the 2nd Defendant was on a frolic of his own when he committed the act of assault and battery on the Plaintiff; and in effect the 1st Defendant cannot be liable for his actions in the circumstances. The immediate presumption this argument elicits is that the 1st Defendant admitted that the 2nd Defendant behaved in the manner alleged by the Plaintiff; but that he must be personally held responsible for his actions. However, the position of the law is that in order for an employer to escape liability or excuse himself from the acts of his employee, the onus is on him to prove that at the material period, the said employee was on a frolic of his own. The position was captured succinctly in Tecno Mechanical Nigeria Limited Vs. Ogunba [2000] 1 NWLR Pt. 639 150, where it was held as follows: “The principle is that once i there exists a master and servant relationship between an employer and a tortfeasor and ii it is established that the tortfeasor committed the wrong complained of in the course of his employment, there is a rebuttable presumption of the employer’s vicarious liability. In such a situation, the onus is on the employer to prove that the alleged wrong was committed by the tortfeasor not in the course of his employment but that it was committed while on a frolic of his own. See Francis Osabe Eseigbe Vs. Agholor [1993] 9 NWLR Pt. 316 128 at 144” In the instant case, the 1st Defendant did not disown the 2nd Defendant. As a matter of fact, the DW1 attempted to give evidence of another version of what transpired inside the bus at the material period by stating in his expunged evidence that it was the Plaintiff that first spat at the 2nd Defendant. Therefore, rather than deny the 2nd Defendant’s act, the 1st Defendant merely attempted to justify it.  However, I have noted the testimony of the DW1 that by Clause 16 of the conditions of employment attached to Exhibit D1, employees of the 1st Defendant are specifically forbidden from engaging in a fight or open quarrel during duty hours. I have examined clause 16 of the contract of employment, Exhibit D1. It states as follows: “16. No EMPLOYEE shall engage in a fight or open quarrel of any kind in the business premises of the COMPANY, or during duty hours, including break periods, provided that an aggrieved EMPLOYEE may report to the COMPANY or her agent, any matter considered provocative by any person requiring attention andor disciplinary action.” More particularly, under the segment titled SPECIFIC CONDITIONS FOR DRIVERS, in Exhibit D1, the provision of clause 11 ix thereof states thus: “11. The driver hereby covenants as follows: ix To ensure that the passengers in the vehicle under his management and control are not molested andor assaulted by servants or agents of the company or other persons.” The question that arises here therefore is whether, on the basis of the clauses contained in Exhibit D1, reproduced in the foregoing, and the testimony the DW1, the 1st Defendant has satisfactorily rebutted the presumption of liability on her for the acts of the 2nd Defendant? in other words, does the fact that the 1st Defendant has specifically forbidden the 2nd Defendant from molesting or assaulting passengers whilst on duty, exculpate her from liability for the 2nd Defendant’s wrongful actions in the circumstances of the present case? From the evidence adduced by the DW1, as highlighted in the foregoing, what has been clearly established is that the 2nd Defendant acted contrary to the terms and conditions of his employment, by attacking the Plaintiff, although his wrong and unauthorized actions were carried out in the course of his employment. But then, in Afribank Nigeria Plc. Vs. Adigun [2009] 11 NWLR Pt. 1152 329 @ 349, cited by Mr. Adeniyi, it was held that the acts of an employee would be deemed to be done in the course of his employment for which the employer shall be held liable, if it is a wrongful act authorized by the employer or a wrongful and unauthorized mode of doing some act authorized by the employer. In Awache Vs. Chime [1990 5 NWLR Pt. 150 302 @ 309, the Court of Appeal, per Uwaifo, JCA as he then was, held as follows: “The wrongful act of a servant is deemed to be done in the course of his employment if what happened was merely a wrongful and unauthorized or prohibited mode of performing some duty the servant was employed to do.” In the present case, the action of the 2nd Defendant, has been specifically prohibited and unauthorized by his employers, the 1st Defendant. The authorities have held that even where an employer expressly forbids the act, as in the instant case, it may still be vicariously liable if it is shown that nonetheless the act was done in the scope of the employment or for the purpose and advancement of the employer’s business. In other words, before an employer can be held vicariously liable for the actions of his employee, it must be established that the acts are done in furtherance of the course and purpose of the employer’s business. See Ruddiman & Company Vs. Smith [1889] 60 LT 708; Rose Vs. Plenty [1976] 1 All ER 97. As evidence in the present case has revealed, not only did the 1st Defendant expressly forbid the 2nd Defendant from engaging in fighting in the course of his employment; it cannot also be said that the very acts of assault and battery inflicted by the 2nd Defendant on the Plaintiff were so done for the purpose or in furtherance of the 1st Defendant’s transport business. As such, I answer the question I have raised in the foregoing in the affirmative, that is that the 1st Defendant has satisfactorily rebutted the presumption of liability on her for the acts of the 2nd Defendant against the Plaintiff. My finding here is that the 2nd Defendant indeed was on the frolic of his own when he committed the acts of assault and battery against the Plaintiff. As such, the 1st Defendant cannot be held culpable for the wrongs committed by the 2nd Defendant. I so hold. Accordingly, I hereby resolve issue 2 against the Plaintiff.  Learned Counsel for the appellant argued that a community reading of the clauses in exhibit D1 relied on by the trial Court show that they did not excuse the 1st respondent from liability that may arise in the event of the breach of the warnings by it to its drivers, that even though the act complained of may not have been done to advance or benefit the employer’s business, it was done within the scope of the 2nd respondent’s employment which is to drive the bus to Lagos, that it was wrong for the trial Court to hold that because exhibit D1 forbade employees from assaulting or molesting passengers in the vehicle under their control and care, the acts of their employees is not that of the employer, that although exhibit D1 warned employees from engaging in those acts, it did not in any way excuse the 1st respondent from liability for acts done by the employees contrary to that warning, that the duty of the Respondents collectively and jointly to the Appellant is to ensure that the Appellant was transported from Abuja to Lagos in the 1st Respondent bus driven and under the control of the 2nd Respondent as employee to the 1st Respondent without molestation, that therefore the acts of molestation and assault occasioned by the 2nd Respondent to the Appellant cannot be severed from the lawful duties of the 2nd Respondent which was to drive the 1st Respondent’s bus to Lagos because they all happened within the same transaction, as the 2nd Respondent did not carry out the alleged acts outside the course of his employment.  Learned Counsel for the 1st respondent argued that the act of assault and battery must be done in the course of the 1st Respondent’s business and for her benefit, that the established facts of this matter is that the 2nd Respondent was employed as Driver of the Bus of the 1st Respondent, that the contract of employment of the 2nd Respondent, Exhibit D1, specifically limited the powers to bind the 1st Respondent, that the alleged assault and battery of the Appellant by the 2nd Respondent is not so connected with the authorized act as to be a mode of doing it, but is entirely an independent act forbidden by the 1st Respondent. The physical assault and battery cannot by any imagination be stretched to be incidental to the job of the 2nd Respondent as defined by Exhibit D1 for the 1st Respondent to be held responsible, that because the 2nd Respondent in such a case is not acting in the course of his employment, but have gone outside of it, he is on a frolic of his own because the area of employment was defined by the 1st Respondent’s express instruction as contained in Exhibit D1 and the alleged assault and battery of the Appellant is so totally unrelated to the work the 2nd Respondent is employed to do that it cannot be understood to mean that it is part of it, that vicarious liability only applies where the employee does an act in carrying out his employer’s work, that if he does an act that is outside his employer’s mandate, the employer won’t be vicariously liable, that the 2nd respondent having acted contrary to the terms and conditions of his employment with the 1st respondent, the latter cannot be held vicariously liable for the said acts as the acts cannot be said to have been done within the scope of his employment to drive the bus from Abuja to Lagos, that the 2nd respondent was indeed on a frolic of his own because the act complained of was not merely a wrongful way of carrying out the job for which he is employed and cannot equally be regarded as a wrongful act authorised by the 1st respondent or a wrongful or authorised mode of doing an authorised act by the 1st respondent, that the cases of S.P.D.C NIG PLC VS. DINO 2007 2 NWLR PT. 1019 438 at 462 and AFRIBANK NIG PLC vs. ADIGUN 2009 11 NWLR PT. 1152 329 at 349 cited by the appellant is inapplicable and is not apposite to the present case and can rightly be distinguished from the case at hand, that in this case the 2nd Respondent veered off completely from the scope of his employment and embarked on a frolic of his own, that assault and battery on the person of the Appellant cannot by any inch be regarded as a wrongful or improper mode of driving a bus from Abuja to Lagos because the act of assault and battery is not so connected with the scope of his employment as to be a mode of doing his job but is an independent act for which the 1st Respondent cannot be held liable as rightly held by the honourable Court.  Let me now consider the merit of the arguments of both sides.  I agree with the submission of Learned Counsel for the 1st respondent that the assault and battery of the appellant by the 2nd respondent was not a method of driving the 1st respondent’s bus from Abuja to Lagos and is not incidental to or part of the process of driving the said bus, that the 1st respondent did not authorise the assault and battery of passengers in the bus he was driving from Abuja to Lagos, that in exhibit D1 it expressly forbade the molestation of passengers in the bus by its employees and that the assault and battery of the appellant was not done to advance or benefit the 1st respondent’s business. But the existence of these facts does not automatically relieve the employer of vicarious liability for the employee’s acts done in the course of carrying out their duties for their employer as in this case. Whether these facts operate to relieve the employer of such liability would depend on the peculiar facts of each case and what should be the justice of the case in the light of those peculiar facts.  The 1st respondent carries on the business of providing commercial passenger services by using its buses to carry commercial passengers to and fro various places in consideration of the fares paid to it by each passenger. To provide this commercial passenger service, the 1st respondent employs drivers to drive each of its buses to convey the passengers to respective destinations. As the owner of the bus conveying the passengers, the 1st respondent owes each passenger a duty of care that obligates it to convey the passenger safely and peacefully to his or her destination. To discharge this duty, its vehicles must be roadworthy and fit to safely and peacefully convey the passengers and the driver it employs to drive each vehicle must be a competent and efficient driver who can ensure that the passengers in the vehicle under his management and control are not molested or assaulted by servants or agents of the company such as the driver himself or other persons.  To ensure that it discharges this duty of care to its passengers, the 1st respondent engaged the 2nd respondent under a written employment contract that required the 2nd respondent ‘to ensure that the passengers in the vehicle under his management and control are not molested andor assaulted by servants or agents of the company or other persons.’  The 1st respondent breached this duty of care to the appellant because it employed a driver who could not ensure that the appellant as a passenger in the 1st respondent’s vehicle under the management and control of the 2nd respondent as its driver conveying the appellant and other passengers from Abuja to Lagos, was not molested and assaulted. The 2nd respondent, who was to ensure that passengers in the bus he was driving were not molested or assaulted was the very one that molested and assaulted the appellant, one of the passengers in the bus under his management and control from Abuja to Lagos. It is the duty of the 1st respondent to employ as drivers, persons that would not molest and assault passengers in the bus under his control and management. If the company engages a driver that can assault passengers in the bus he is driving or engage in any other misconduct that injures the passengers or their property, the company should be liable for breaching its duty of care to the said passengers and be vicariously liable for any loss or injury suffered by the passenger due to the misconduct of the driver irrespective of the facts that the company did not authorise the misconduct, that the misconduct is not part of the process of driving the vehicle or incidental to it and the misconduct is not for the benefit of the company or owner of the vehicle. The owner of a vehicle providing commercial passenger services must take the driver or any of its employees as it employed him and should bear the consequences of engaging a driver that can disobey its lawful instructions to the detriment of its passengers. Having chosen to employ a driver that molest and assault its passengers, it cannot escape liability for the breach of its duty of care to its passengers because the driver had covenanted with it in writing not to molest and or assault passengers who are not privy to such agreement.  The 1st respondent recognised that the driver may molest and assault a passenger and thereby breach that covenant. That is why it required the driver under the written contract to provide a guarantor who shall have a landed property in any of “the major township in Nigeria” and who shall subscribe to a guarantor’s form and indemnity bond. The part of the written employment contract exhibit D1 containing this requirement of a guarantor reads thusly- “Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, nothing in this agreement shall be so construed as to confer to this agreement so as to ensure to the benefit of the EMPLOYEE unless prior to the execution there, the EMPLOYEE produces a substantial guarantor who accordingly signs the Guarantor’s Form and indemnity Bond in the Schedule to this agreement. PROVIDED that as long as the EMPLOYEE fails to provide the said substantial guarantor, his employment shall for all purposes be on temporary basis, notwithstanding the provision of Clause 4 hereof; and notwithstanding anything in this agreement contained, such temporary employment as may be summarily determined by the Company –  1. Every driver shall pursuant to Clause 4 of Part A of this Agreement provide a GUARANTOR who is owner of Landed property in any Major township in Nigeria. 2. For purposes of the foregoing clause, no Landed property worth less than One Million Naira N1m shall be acceptable to the Company. 3. It shall be the duty of the driver to provide to the satisfaction of the company, documentary evidence of the proposed Guarantor’s title and value thereof. 4. Notwithstanding clause 4 of Part A hereof, Vehicle shall be assigned to the driver only after he has subscribed to this Agreement and has produced a Guarantor as aforesaid who shall have subscribed to PART C of this Agreement.”  The driver’s contractual obligation to provide a guarantor to sign the guarantor’s form and indemnity bond is to protect the owner of the bus against any losses it may suffer as a result of the driver’s breach of any of the provisions of the said employment agreement. This is obvious from the express terms of the guarantor form and indemnity bond signed by one Mr. Sunday Odo as a guarantor that 2nd respondent shall faithfully and diligently carry out his duty. The said form and bond reads thusly- “GUARANTOR’S FORM AND INDEMNITY BOND TO E. EKESONS BROTHERS NIGERIA LIMITED of No. 100 Badagry Express Way, Alafia, Orile Iganmu, Lagos IN CONSIDERATION of your employing MrMrsMiss Mr Jude Eze of ... as per this Contract of Employment dated the 1012008 day of ... 19 ... 1. I, ChiefMr.Mrs.Miss ... Mr. Sunday Odo of ... HEREBY GUARANTEE to you the faithful and dill-performance of the Contract of Employment by the said Mr. Mrs. Miss ... Jude Eze without committing any breach of isher obligations thereunder. 2.

I am worth well over N5,000,000 and I am owner of the following a. Car b. Land c. House 4. THIS GUARANTEE is to be a continuing guarantee and is to continue to be binding on me as long as the Contract of Employment remains in force. 5. I RESERVE the right to myself or my personal representatives by one month’s notice in writing to you at any time to revoke this Guarantee as to all future dealings by you with the Employees. DATED THE ... DAY OF ... 19 ... SIGNED ... Witness to the GUARANTEE: Signed: ... Name: Obum Ojobo Address: Ojobo NO. 28 Towolawi street Occupation: Business.”  So exhibit D1 gives the 1st respondent the right to recover from the 2nd respondent or the guarantor any payments to any passenger for injuries inflicted on such passenger by the misconduct of the 2nd respondent.  The DW1 who is the 1st respondent’s rescue officer testified under cross examination that the 2nd respondent verbally reported the incident involving the appellant on 2372011 and ceased working for the 1st respondent from 192011. There is no explanation on how the 2nd respondent stopped working for the 1st respondent. There is no evidence of the where about of the 2nd respondent since he ceased working for the 1st respondent. The record of this appeal show that he was served the processes in this suit by the substituted method of delivering them to the office of the 1st respondent as his employer, following the order that he be so served, which order was granted on 13-12-2011, long after he had ceased to be an employee of the 1st respondent. It is clear from the record of this appeal that the 2nd respondent did not participate in the trial proceedings in person or by a legal practitioner. He did not file any process in the proceedings and did not defend the suit against him. There is nothing to show that the 1st respondent who received the originating processes on his behalf made him aware of the suit against him. What is clear from the record of this appeal is that the 2nd respondent after reporting the incident to DW1 simply disappeared into thin air and cannot be traced by anybody including the 1st respondent who had employed him as a driver. In these circumstances, considering that the 2nd respondent assaulted and battered the appellant in the course of his employment with the 1st respondent, justice cannot be done if the 1st respondent is not held vicariously liable to the appellant for the injury he suffered from the said assault and battery.  The argument of learned counsel for the respondent that the assault and battery of the appellant by the 2nd respondent cannot be regarded as having been done in the course of his employment with the 1st respondent because his contract of service with the 1st respondent, exhibit D1 expressly forbade such act is not valid because there is no ground of this appeal against the trial Court’s findings that-  “parties are not in dispute that the 2nd Defendant drove the 1st Defendant’s bus in the course of his employment with the 1st Defendant on the dates in question. It is also established that the assault and battery incident was perpetrated by the 2nd Defendant against the Plaintiff inside the said bus that belonged to the 1st Defendant, whilst the 2nd Defendant was driving the same from Abuja to Lagos on the dates in question, in the course of his employment ... From the evidence adduced by the DW1, as highlighted in the foregoing, what has been clearly established is that the 2nd Defendant acted contrary to the terms and conditions of his employment, by attacking the Plaintiff, although his wrong and unauthorized actions were carried out in the course of his employment.\"  The respondents did not cross-appeal against these findings. By not appealing these findings, all parties herein accepted them as correct, conclusive and binding on them. See Iyoho V Effiong. Having accepted the findings as correct, the 1st respondent cannot competently and validly argue that the battery of the appellant by the 2nd respondent was not in the course of the 2nd respondent’s employment with the 1st respondent. See Dabup V Kolo.  The trial Court also found that the 1st respondent did not disown the 2nd respondent’s actions and rather tried to justify it as the evidence of DW1 shows. What the trial Court considered in determining if the 1st respondent was vicariously liable was the fact that the 2nd respondents actions were expressly prohibited by exhibit D1 and not whether the action were carried out in the course of employment. It held that 2nd respondent assaulted and battered the appellant in the course of his employment but because the act was prohibited by his employer and was not for the benefit of his employer, he acted on his own frolic. This is clear from the part of its judgment that read thusly-  “The question that arises here therefore is whether, on the basis of the clauses contained in Exhibit D1, reproduced in the foregoing, and the testimony the DW1, the 1st Defendant has satisfactorily rebutted the presumption of liability on her for the acts of the 2nd Defendant? In other words, does the fact that the 1st Defendant has specifically forbidden the 2nd Defendant from molesting or assaulting passengers whilst on duty, exculpate her from liability for the 2nd Defendant’s wrongful actions in the circumstances of the present case”. But then, in Afribank Nigeria Plc. Vs. Adigun [2009] 11 NWLR Pt. 1152 329 @ 349, cited by Mr. Adeniyi, it was held that the acts of an employee would be deemed to be done in the course of his employment for which the employer shall be held liable, if it is a wrongful act authorized by the employer or a wrongful and unauthorized mode of doing some act authorized by the employer. In Awache Vs. Chime [1990 5 NWLR Pt. 150 302 @ 309, the Court of Appeal, per Uwaifo, JCA as he then was, held as follows: “...The wrongful act of a servant is deemed to be done in the course of his employment if what happened was merely a wrongful and unauthorized or prohibited mode of performing some duty the servant was employed to do.” In the present case, the action of the 2nd Defendant, has been specifically prohibited and unauthorized by his employers, the 1st Defendant. The authorities have held that even where an employer expressly forbids the act, as in the instant case, it may still be vicariously liable if it is shown that nonetheless the act was done in the scope of the employment or for the purpose and advancement of the employer’s business. In other words, before an employer can be held vicariously liable for the actions of his employee, it must be established that the acts are done in furtherance of the course and purpose of the employer’s business. See Ruddiman & Company Vs. Smith [1889] 60 LT 708; Rose Vs. Plenty [1976] 1 All ER 97. As evidence in the present case has revealed, not only did the 1st Defendant expressly forbid the 2nd Defendant from engaging in fighting in the course of his employment; it cannot also be said that the very acts of assault and battery inflicted by the 2nd Defendant on the Plaintiff were so done for the purpose or in furtherance of the 1st Defendant’s transport business. As such, I answer the question I have raised in the foregoing in the affirmative, that is that the 1st Defendant has satisfactorily rebutted the presumption of liability on her for the acts of the 2nd Defendant against the Plaintiff. My finding here is that the 2nd Defendant indeed was on the frolic of his own when he committed the acts of assault and battery against the Plaintiff. As such, the 1st Defendant cannot be held culpable for the wrongs committed by the 2nd Defendant. I so hold.  A distinguishing feature of this present case is that the unauthorised and wrongful actions of an employee done in the course of his employment has not only injured a third party, but has also resulted in a breach of a duty of care owed by his employer to the third party under a contract of carriage between the employer and the third party. So the vicarious liability of the 1st respondent arises not only from the fact that the 2nd respondent is its employee but also from the fact of the contract of carriage and the breach of the duty of care under the contract. Another distinguishing feature that makes it imperative to hold the 1st respondent vicariously liable for its driver’s actions is the fact that the 1st respondent’s said driver can no longer be found or traced after the incident.  In the light of the foregoing, I resolve issues 1 and 2 in favour of the appellant.  On the whole, this appeal succeeds as it has merit. It is allowed. Accordingly, the judgment of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory in Suit No. FCTHCCV932011 delivered on 2992014 by Olukayode A. Adeniyi J holding that the plaintiff’s case did not succeed against the 1st defendant and dismissing the plaintiff’s case against the 1st defendant is hereby set aside. It is hereby adjudged that the plaintiff’s case also succeeds against the 1st defendant, that the 1st defendant shall pay the sum of One Million Naira to the appellant as damages for the 2nd defendant’s assault and battery of the plaintiff in the course of the 2nd defendant employment with the 1st defendant.  The 1st respondent herein shall pay costs of N300,000.00 to the appellant.   STEPHEN JONAH ADAH, J.C.A.:  I was availed the draft of the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Emmanuel Akomaye Agim, JCA.  I am in total agreement with his reasoning and conclusion that the appeal succeeds on merit.  The key issue or the fulcrum of the instant appeal is whether the 1st Respondent was vicariously liable for the negligence or injury caused to the Appellant by the 2nd Respondent who was an employee of the 1st Respondent. Vicarious Liability is a doctrine of law imposing liability on a person for the actionable conduct of another based on the relationship between two persons such as in MasterServant or PrincipalAgent relationship. This principle of law is a variant of the general rule that everyone is personally responsible and liable for his own faults. The cardinal principle of liability is that the party complained of should owe to the party complaining a duty of care, and that the party complaining should be able to prove that he has suffered damage in consequence of the breach of that duty. SeeOrhue v. NEPA 1998 7 NWLR Pt. 557 187.  In the instant case, there is clear evidence that the 2nd Respondent who is the tort feasor is a servant of the 1st Respondent. The lower Court also accepted the evidence that the injury caused the appellant by the 2nd Respondent was in the course of the employment of the 2nd Respondent by the 1st Respondent. It is so clear here that the 2nd Respondent was a servant of the 1st Respondent. The 1st Respondent relied on Exhibit D1 particularly clauses 16 & 11 IX, to reject or deny liability. These clauses specify as follows: “16 No employee shall engage in a fight or open quarrel of any kind in the business premises of the company, or during duty hours including break periods, provided that an aggrieved employee may report to the company or her agent any matter considered provocative by any person requiring attention and or disciplinary action. 11 The driver hereby covenant as follows: IX To ensure that the passengers in the vehicle under his management and control are not molested and or assaulted by servants or agents of the company or other person\".  It is very clear and without any dispute that these clauses are the covenant and conditions of service of the 2nd Respondent. These clauses only operate between the 1st and 2nd Respondents. Covenant in any contract of employment cannot be laid to sabotage the duty of care owed third parties who are not privy to the contract. Those clauses for what they are, are operational clauses binding the parties to the MasterServant contract. The clauses were not meant to operate in the contract of carriage between the Appellant and the Respondents. Those clauses at best can be used by the 1st Respondent to punish the 2nd Respondent or determine the employment of the 2nd Respondent but can never be used to downgrade or jeopardize the duty of care owed the Appellant by the Respondents. In the same vein, the 1st Respondent cannot use the clauses to run away from the liability of his servant who caused the injury to the appellant in the cause of his employment. It is in this respect and for the detailed reasons advanced in the lead judgment of my learned brother that I too find this appeal meritorious.  I abide by the consequential orders as made in the lead judgment.   PETER OLABISI IGE, J.C.A.:  I agree.-end!" ;

The trial court established that –  1.the 2nd Respondent/Driver drove the 1st Respondent’s bus in the course of his employment with the Transportation company on the dates in question.  2.that the assault and battery incident was perpetrated by the 2nd Defendant against the Plaintiff inside the said bus that belonged to the 1st Defendant, whilst the 2nd Defendant was driving the same from Abuja to Lagos on the dates in question, in the course of his employment. However, the trial court also found that -  1.the conditions of employment of employees of the 1st Defendant specifically forbid them from engaging in a fight or open quarrel during duty hours  2.the 2nd Defendant/driver acted contrary to the terms and conditions of his employment, by attacking the Plaintiff, although his wrong and unauthorized actions were carried out in the course of his employment. The trial Court therefore ruled against the Plaintiff and dismissed their case. -" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  MUDASHIRU NASIRU ONIYANGI, J.C.A. Delivering the Lead Ruling:  The Applicants by way of a motion on notice brought pursuant to Section 242 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended, Section 15 and 24 4 of the Court of Appeal Act and Order 6 Rules 1, 6 and 7 of the Court of Appeal Rules, 2016 and under the inherent jurisdiction of the Court prayed for the following orders: 1. Extension of time for leave of Court to Appeal against the decision of the Sharia Court of Appeal, Borno State in Appeal No: BOSSCACV092005 between BABAN GIDA DANLAMI, HABIBU AND MOHAMMED SANI to this Honourable Court. 2. Leave of Court to Appeal against the decision of the Sharia Court of Appeal, Borno State in Appeal No. BOSSCACV092005 between BABAN GIDA DANLAMI, HABIBU AND MOHAMMED SANI to this Honourable Court. 3. Extension of the time within which to file notice and grounds of Appeal against the decision of Sharia Court of Appeal, Borno State in Appeal No: BOSSCACV092005 between BABAN GIDA DANLAMI, HABIBU AND MOHAMMED SANI to this Honourable Court. 4. And for any order or further orders as the Court may deem fit to make in the circumstance.  The grounds upon which the application is predicated are: 1 The Applicants are aggrieved with the decision of the Sharia Court of Appeal, Borno State. 2 The Appeal contains a recondite point of law that touches on jurisdiction and Islamic law. 3 That the time within which to file notice and ground of Appeal has expired. 4 The Applicants without leave of the Court cannot appeal.  The application is supported by an affidavit of eleven paragraphs and two annexure namely: 1 The Judgment of the Sharia Court of Appeal, Borno State marked Exhibit A. 2 Proposed Notice and Grounds of Appeal marked Exhibit B.  The applicant also filed a written address as ordered by the Court on the 17th day of May, 2019. Upon all the foregoing, the Applicants relied in urging the Court to grant the reliefs sought.  In opposing the application, the Respondent filed a counter affidavit of sixteen paragraphs. He also filed written address on the 10th June 2019. He urged the Court to dismiss the application.  The facts leading to this application as can be captured from the processes filed by parties is that the Applicants as plaintiffs sued the Respondent before Gamboru Sharia Court, Maiduguri in the year 2000 seeking amongst others the retrieval and distribution of estate of their father which were said to have been entrusted with the Respondent. Judgment was entered in favour of the Applicant on the 12th day of May 2003. Aggrieved by the outcome, the Respondent appealed to the Upper Sharia Court 1 Maiduguri. The Upper Sharia Court in its judgment delivered on the 4th day of January, 2005 allowed the Appeal and set aside the judgment of the Sharia Court and ordered a retrial.  The Applicant appealed the judgment to the Sharia Court of Appeal on the 4th day of February 2005. On the 22nd day of May, 2017, the Appeal was allowed in part. An order of retrial by the Upper Sharia Court 1. Maiduguri was also made. Dissatisfied with the outcome, hence this Application for trinity prayers for extension of time to Appeal and leave to Appeal in that the period allowed to appeal under the law has expired.  Respective Counsel filed and exchanged their brief of argument as indicated herein below.  In the brief of argument filed on behalf of the Applicant, authored by Zanna Hamza Esq., the following lone issue is submitted for the determination of the Appeal. Whether the Applicants are entitled to be granted the relief sought. The Respondent did not submit any new issue in his brief of argument authored by A. A. Sanni Esq. rather he adopted the lone issue formulated by the learned counsel representing the Applicant. In the light of the foregoing developments, the sole issue submitted by the Applicant is hereby adopted for the determination of this application.  The learned Counsel representing the applicants argued that in an application of this nature, the Court has to consider the following elements. a Whether the Applicants have given good and substantial reasons for the failure to Appeal within time. b Whether the Applicants have shown prima facie good cause why the Appeal should be heard.  Relying on the cases of IFEKANDU AND ANOR v. JULIUS UZOEGWU 2008 5-6 S.C. PT.1 220, JIMOH v. MIN. F.C.T. 2019 5 NWLR PT.1664 45 at 66. And paragraphs 5, 6, and 7 of the Applicants affidavit in support submitted that the applicants have shown good reasons for the delay and which reasons is the intervention of the elders to stay further litigation. In compliance with the resolution, the applicants desist from any further form of action, but when the Applicants noticed breach of the resolution by the Respondent hence their decision to pursue this application.  In fulfillment of the second condition, he contended that the Ground of Appeal as stated in Exhibit B attachment to the application raises serious issue of law challenging the jurisdiction of the Court. He relied on the case of JIMOH v. MIN FCT supra where Rhodes Vivour JSC said this: Finally, if the grounds of appeal complains of lack of jurisdiction and it appears so, the Court would no longer inquire into the reasons for the delay. See FEDERAL HOUSING AUTHORITY v. KALEJAIYE 2010 10 NWLR PT. 1226 P. 147, FAMU AND 2 ORS v. KASSIM AND 2 ORS 2012 11 SC P. 43, 2013 7 NWLR PT.1352 166, FHA v. ABOSEDE 1998 2 NWLR PT.537 P.177, KOTOYE v. SARAKI 1995 5 NWLR PT.395 256, IBODO v. ENAROFIA 1980 5 - 7 SCP 43. UKWU v. BUNGE 1997 8 NWLR PT.518 P.527.  Referring to ground one of the Notice and grounds of Appeal which is- The learned Kadis of the Sharia Court of Appeal, Borno State erred in law when they held that appellate Upper Sharia Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine an Appeal by a lone judge.  He contended that the counter affidavit by the Respondent did not raise any issue why the application would not be granted. He urged the Court to grant the application.  In opposing the grant of the application, the Respondent argued that the Applicants are Plaintiffs before the Gamboru Sharia Court in the year 2000 in suit No. CV3702000 and which case lasts for 3 years Three years and determined in favour of the Applicants. The Respondent appealed against the judgment and succeeded in setting aside the judgment of Gamboru Sharia Court on the 4th of April 2005. The Applicants appealed to the Sharia Court of Appeal and for lack of diligent prosecution, the Appeal was struck out on 8th April, 2010. In another development, the lower Court ordered a retrial. It is against this order that the Applicants are seeking for the order of the Court to Appeal. He contended further that the Respondents have effectively countered the deposition in paragraph 3 and 4 of his counter affidavit on the issues that the elders asked parties to stay action. He submitted that the Applicant has not shown any good reason why they could not appeal within time. He added that for an application of this nature for extension of time to succeed, the applicant must show to the Court that the delay in bringing the application is neither willful nor inordinate and that there are good and substantial reason for failure to Appeal. He relied on the following cases:- OKERE v. NLEM 1992 4 NWLR PT.234 132, C.C.B NIG LTD v. OGWURU 1993 3 NWLR PT.284 630 SC. S.B.N PLC VS. ABDULKADIR 1996 4 NWLR PT.443 460 CA, OGBOGORO v. OMENUWOMA 2005 1 NWLR PT.906 1 and F.G.N v. A.I.C. LTD 2006 4 NWLR PT.970 337.  He contended further that the ground of Appeal raised by the Applicants challenging the jurisdiction of the Upper Sharia Court 1, Maiduguri to entertain the Appeal was never canvassed before the said Upper Sharia Court 1. Maiduguri. He submitted that the issue of jurisdiction raised is not bona fide but raised only to support the application. He concluded that the Applicants wanted to appeal against the order of a retrial by the lower Court Sharia Court of Appeal but did not provide any substantial or cogent reasons why they could not appeal within time and neither do they have any good reason disclosed by their grounds of Appeal and that the Applicants substantive case before the Upper Sharia Court 1 has been struck out for lack of diligent prosecution. He added that the applicant has been prosecuting this matter for the past 19 years and by that, depriving the Respondent of all his assets. He urged the Court to dismiss the application with substantial cost.  In the application at hand, the Applicants are asking the Court to exercise its discretionary power in his favour and grant the reliefs sought. It has become notorious that for a Court to exercise its discretionary power, such discretion must not only be exercised judicially but judiciously. I am equally not unmindful of the settled concept that the question of the exercise of discretion is governed by several factors, at the same time, those factors are not necessarily constant hence they change with changing circumstance and time. See HALIRU v. FRN. 2008 ALL FWLR PT.425 1697 at 1726 1727., HARUNA v. MODIBBO 2005 16 NWLR PT.900 P. 487, IDEOZU v. OCHOMA 2006 4 NWLR PT.970 364. Let me add that a judicial discretion ought to be founded upon the facts and circumstances presented to the Court from which it must draw a conclusion governed by the law. Therefore, it must be exercised honestly and in the spirit of the statute otherwise the act done would not fall within the statute. See the case of UNIVERSITY OF LAGOS AND ORS v. C.I.O. OLANIYAN AND ORS. 1985 1 SC 295 at Page 344  345. In the case of ANPP v. RESIDENT ELECTORAL COMMISSIONER AKWA IBOM STATE 2008 8 NWLR PT.1090 453 at 513, the Supreme Court said thus: Judicial Discretion is a science of understanding to discern between falsity and truth, between a shadow and substance, between equity and colourable glosses and preference and not to do to their wills and private affection.  Bearing the foregoing in mind and considering the facts of this case wherein the Applicant got judgment in his favour. The Respondent appealed against the said judgment. An order of retrial was made. Applicant posited that there was an intervention by elders for a peaceful resolution of the matter and hence he refrained from any further litigation which the Respondent denied, but upon the activation of a process toward the order of retrial, the applicant ignited this application.  The Respondent categorically and materially denied any dispute resolution by the elders, see paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Counter affidavit by the Respondent. The Applicant did not react to this deposition by way of any further affidavit. This in essence, constitute an admission of the averments in the counter affidavit of the Respondent by the Applicant.  I have equally considered the issue of jurisdiction raised by the Applicant as the second ground to buttress his application. Issue of jurisdiction is the authority or power of the Court to determine the subject matter in controversy between parties. See BABALOLA v. OBAOKU  OTE 2005 8 NWLR PT.927 386, USMAN v. K.S.H.A. 2007 11 NWLR PT.1044 P. 148. It is trite that issue of jurisdiction can be raised at any stage of the proceedings and even on Appeal. See IJEBU-ODE L.G. v. ADEDEJI BALOGUN AND CO. LTD 1991 1 NWLR PT.166 136, NATIONAL BANK OF NIGERIA LTD v. JOHN AKINWUMI SHOYOYE & ANOR 1977 5 SC 110, CHIEF IKEDI OHAKIM v. CHIEF MARTIN AGBASO AND ORS 2010 19 NWLR PT.1226 172, SAMSON OWIE v. SOLOMON IGHIWI 2005 5 NWLR PT.917 184.  The contention of the Applicant under this ground is that his ground of Appeal raises serious issue of Law i.e. issue of jurisdiction of the appellate Upper Sharia Court which is the trial appellate Court Sharia Court of Appeal concluded had the jurisdiction. Contrary to the assertion of the Respondent that the issue of jurisdiction was never canvassed at the lower Court, I found that the lower Court in its judgment on pages 5-9 properly considered the issue of jurisdiction and in its wisdom concluded in favour of the Respondent. In the light of this, it is my humble view that the issue of jurisdiction of the Upper Sharia Court is one of the live issues determined by the Lower Court and hence the Applicant has the vires to still activate and contest it in this Court or at the Apex Court even if it has not been raised before. In this Appeal, both parties joined issues on it before the Lower Court and the Lower Court made a pronouncement on it. The contention of the Respondent thereof in my view that it was not an issue before the lower Court, to say a little is designed to mislead the Court. I strongly condemn this in all ramifications. Having gone this far, and the fact that an issue of jurisdiction is a recondite point of law which constitutes a substantial and good reason to anchor an Appeal, I have no hesitation in my mind that exercising the Courts discretion in favour of the Applicant based on this ground alone will not only be judicial and judicious but also legal.  On that note, I answer the question in the affirmative and resolve the sole issue against the Respondent.  In effect, the objection by the Respondent to the application is overruled and dismissed. In consequence, the application is hereby granted.  Accordingly, order is hereby granted to the Applicant in the following terms. 1 Time is extended for the Applicants to seek leave to Appeal against the decision of the Sharia Court of Appeal Borno State in Appeal No: BOSSCACV092005, between BABAN GIDA, DAN LAMI, HABIBU AND MOHAMMED SANI delivered on 22nd day of May, 2017. 2 Leave is granted to the Applicants to appeal against the aforesaid judgment of the Borno State Sharia Court of Appeal. 3 Time is Extended for the Applicants to file and serve their notice and ground of Appeal against the aforesaid judgment of the Borno State Sharia Court of Appeal. 4 Applicants to file and serve their notice and ground of Appeal at the lower Court within 14 days from today. Parties to bear their respective cost.   ADZIRA GANA MSHELIA, J.C.A.:  I read before now the Ruling of my learned brother, Oniyangi, J.C.A, just delivered. I agree that the application is meritorious and same granted. I endorse all the orders made in the leading Ruling, inclusive of costs.   BOLOUKUROMO MOSES UGO, J.C.A.:  I had read in draft the ruling of my learned brother MUDASHIRU NASIRU ONIYANGI, J.C.A. and I am in agreement that the application for extension of time to appeal has merit and is hereby granted by me too. I also agree with the consequential orders made in the lead ruling by my learned brother including that as to costs.-end!  " ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  OLUKAYODE ARIWOOLA, J.S.C. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  This is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Enugu division given on Friday 20th December, 2013. The appellant and one other had earlier been arraigned before the Enugu State High Court, sitting at the Nsukka Judicial division, on 21072003.  They were charged with conspiracy to murder, and murder of Christopher Ogbonna, the Chief Security Officer of University of Nigeria, Nsukka.  The information filed by the then Attorney General of Enugu State on the said two counts charge reads thus: Count 1- Conspiracy - contrary to Section 494 of the Criminal Code, Cap.36, Vol.1 Laws of Anambra State of Nigeria 1986, as applicable to Enugu State of Nigeria. Particulars: Clement Ezeazu alias Fimmbbar and Chijioke Ugwu, alias Police on or about the 26th day of May, 2002, at No. 449, Elias Avenue, University of Nigeria, Nsukka Campus, in the Nsukka Judicial Division conspired to commit a felony - Murder. Count 2 - Murder - contrary to Section 274 1 of the Criminal Code, Cap.36, Vol.1, Laws of Anambra State of Nigeria, 1986, as applicable to Enugu State ofÂ Nigeria. Particulars: Clement Ezeazu alias Fimmbbar and Chijioke Ugwu alias Police on or about the 26th day of May, 2002 at No. 449 Elias Avenue University of Nigeria, Nsukka Campus, in the Nsukka Judicial Division unlawfully killed Christopher Ogbonna.  Upon their arraignment and the charge read to them, their plea was taken. However, upon an application for bail pending trial brought before a vacation Judge of the High Court, in Enugu, Clement Ezeazu, the first accused was granted bail. He later jumped bail and has remained at large. Efforts to re-arrest and bring him to Court to stand trial proved abortive. Subsequently, the State with leave of the Court amended the information to drop the name of the first accused - Clement Ezeazu, leaving the appellant alone to stand the trial.  During the trial, the prosecution called eight 8 witnesses and the appellant testified in defence but called no other witness. The gist of the case goes as follows:- About 9pm of the 26th day of May, 2002, some men with guns invaded the official residence of Mr. Christopher Ogbonna  the Chief Security Officer of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka at Nsukka Elias Avenue, University of Nigeria, Nsukka campus. The said men held Mrs Ogbonna wife of the deceased, and her children hostage. They seized some of their properties including money. They raped two daughters of the deceased and killed Mr. Ogbonna and later escaped from the house.  PW1  Chukwuka Ogbonna is the first son of the deceased. He was not in the house when the gunmen arrived. After over powering all the occupants of the flat, the assailants took positions, switched off the light and began to intimidate and harass the family of the deceased. The gunmen brought out assorted drinks kept in the house by the deceased and began to entertain themselves. They made it clear to the family that their mission was to kill the Chief Security Officer when he returned, failing which his first son would be killed.  PW1, being a student had gone out to study inside the campus hence was not in the house when the gunmen came. On arrival, he noticed that the security guard was not downstairs where he was supposed to be. He got upstairs to their flat to discover that the light had been switched off, even though the door was left opened. He entered their flat and switched on the light only to see a gunman standing between the refrigerator and the wall, pointing a gun at him. The gunman began to command PW1. He recognized the gunman as the appellant. Other gunmen then came out from the kitchen and bed rooms and he readily recognized also one Clement Ezeazu. The deceased, who had been out of the house then came in. He was immediately disarmed and shot several times. He was later confirmed dead at the University Medical Centre. PW3 - a medical doctor carried out an autopsy on the body of the deceased. He testified that the deceased died as a result of multiple bullet wounds, one of which shattered his heart.  In the course of investigation, the police arrested, among others, the appellant and Clement Ezeazu - the 1st accused in the original information. Upon the execution of search warrant in the house of the suspects, several incriminating items were found in the house of Clement Ezeazu, including some of the bottles of the drinks suspected to have been removed from the house of the deceased. They were all tendered and admitted as Exhibits.  PW4 and PW5 are the grown up daughters of the deceased who narrated in their testimonies the sordid acts of rape on them by the assailants.  The defence put up by the appellant in his testimony was entirely a total denial of involvement. Indeed, he claimed an alibi. He claimed to have been off duty on that day and had gone to receive treatment from one Mrs Igboji  a nurse working with bishop Shanahan Hospital, Nsukka. He further testified that after receiving treatment, he had returned to his house and was with his mother till the following day. He wondered why PW1 claimed to have seen him at the scene when both of them attended a meeting the following day, for the burial of the deceased.  At the conclusion of the trial and after written addresses of both counsel, in its considered judgment, the trial Court found the appellant guilty as charged. He was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging.  Aggrieved by the judgment of the trial Court led to an appeal to the Court below.  At the Court below, the appeal was found lacking in merit and was accordingly dismissed. The conviction and sentence of the appellant were consequently affirmed. Further aggrieved led to the instant appeal to this Court on two grounds of appeal.  When the matter came up for hearing on 31102019, Mr. A. Akaraiwe of counsel who led other counsel for the appellant identified the brief of argument filed on 1352015 for the appellant. He adopted and relied on same to urge the Court to allow the appeal.  The following sole issue was distilled from the two grounds of appeal filed by the appellant: “Whether the Justices of the Court of Appeal were not in error when in upholding the decision of the trial Court, held that identification parade was unnecessary rather the question that arises therein is whether there was reasonable opportunity for PW1 to have correctly recognized the person he saw pointing gun at him in their sitting room that night as the Appellant.\"  Learned appellants counsel contended that it is settled that identification parade is not usually conducted for cosmetic reasons. He relied on Chukwu Vs. The State 1992 7 NWLR Pt.253 325 at 335 and Afolabi Vs. State 2010 16 NWLR Pt.1220 584. He gave the circumstances when the conduct of identification parade is usually required. He submitted that the instant case is an ideal situation requiring the conduct of identification parade. He referred to the testimony of PW1 on his contact with the appellant on the night of the incident. Learned counsel contended that from the testimony of PW1, the incident took place at night, the encounter with the alleged gunman was brief and that PW1 had mistaken the assailant to be his younger brother even though he came face to face with him. The PW1 even thought he was dreaming. Learned counsel submitted that the brevity of the circumstances of the encounter did not afford the PW1 full opportunity of clearly observing the features of the assailant and therefore he could not correctly identify who the assailant was. He submitted further that there are hundreds of people out there who look like PW1s younger brother and to ensure that an innocent person does not suffer unjustly, an identification parade would have been conducted by the Police to enable PW1 identify the assailant.  Learned counsel contended further that the need for an identification parade became more compelling as: a The appellant was not arrested at the scene of the crime and PW1 did not know the name of the appellant but got to know it later at the Police Station. b Even the Security Officer PW6 attached to the deceased house that has worked in the same department with the appellant and the deceased for nine whole years testified that he did not see appellant or any other members of the security department among the assailants that night, even though they had ample opportunity of seeing the assailants as they were at home and their light was on when the assailants came in and the gunmen were not masked.  Learned counsel submitted that where an eye witness fails, at earliest opportunity, to mention the name of the person known to him who he claims to have committed the offence, such evidence of identification at a later stage ought to be approached with caution. He relied on Bozin Vs. The State 1985 7 SC 450 at 469; Morka Vs. The State 19982 NWLR Pt.557 294 at 302.  Learned counsel contended that it is note worthy that it was only PW1 who testified of seeing the appellant, whereas his two sisters, i.e. PW4 and PW5 who were also familiar with their father’s office and workers did not mention seeing the appellant among the assailants that killed their father on that fateful night. He relied on Abudu Vs. The State 1991 1 NWLR Pt. 168 490 at 506. He submitted that where there is defence of alibi, a trial Court should be cautious in relying on the evidence of a single witness. Learned counsel contended that, the appellant timeously raised the defence of alibi which the police never investigated, yet he was convicted upon the evidence of PW1 who claimed he saw the appellant on that fateful night. He relied on Ibane Vs. The State 2012 LPELR - 9326 CA.  He submitted that the circumstance of identification that linked the appellant with the offence is not cogent enough to ground a conviction of the appellant. He urged the Court to so hold. Learned counsel further submitted that the evidence of the prosecution witness that he recognizes the appellant under the circumstances given in this case is suspicious. He contended that the investigation and the alleged identification of the appellant by PW1 is not sufficient to exclude identification parade. He relied on Eyisi Vs. The State 2001 FWLR Pt.35 750.  He urged the Court to allow the appeal and set aside the concurrent judgments ofÂ the two Courts below.  Chief M. E. Eze - the Hon. Attorney General of Enugu State for the respondent, leading Messrs T. A. Ngene; U. D. Neboh and K.K. Odugu, identified the brief of argument filed on 191015 for the respondent. He referred to the Preliminary objection and in its entirety, urged the Court to dismiss the appeal.  It is note worthy that the appellant did not file any reply to the respondents brief of argument.  The respondent had raised a preliminary objection to Ground one of the appellants Notice of Appeal and the issue distilled therefrom on the ground that both are incompetent not being based on or derived from the decision of the Court below appealed against. Learned counsel submitted that the said ground of appeal and the issue formulated therefrom are both liable to be struck out, the same not being based on or derived from the ratio decidendi of the decision of the Court below, subject matter of the instant appeal. He referred to the judgment of the Court below on pages 235 lines 9-14 and 236 of the record of appeal. He contended that the decision of the Court below was clearly not based on the alleged decision by the trial Court that an identification parade was unnecessary, the same not being a ground of the appeal in the Court below. He contended that an appeal must be based on the decision or ratio decidendi of the lower Court and from which issues must directly flow and be formulated. Where it is otherwise or the converse is the case, the Court is enjoined to discountenance both the ground of appeal and the issue formulated thereon as inconsequential and liable to be struck out. He relied on Chief Walter O. Mere & Anor Vs. Eze Emmanuel Njemanze 2008 All FWLR Pt.426 1956; Mercantile Bank of Nigeria Plc Vs. Linus Nwobodo 2005 7 SC Pt.1 1.  Learned counsel contended that the appellant herein misconceived the issue and set up for himself a case that did not exist. He stated that the Court below did not decide or uphold the decision of the trial Court that an identification parade was unnecessary since the appellant did not complain of that part of the decision of the trial Court in any of the grounds of appeal to the Court below. He submitted that Ground one of the appellants Notice of Appeal to this Court is incompetent, the same not having arisen from the ratio of the decision of the Court below. He relied on Sanni Abdullahi Vs. The State 2013 All FWLR Pt.699 118 at 1129. He urged the Court to strike out the incompetent ground and the lone issue said to have been formulated therefrom.  Learned counsel referred to Ground two of the Notice of Appeal and contended that no issue was formulated therefrom and is therefore deemed abandoned. He submitted that the appeal ought to be dismissed in its entirety and urged the Court to do so.  Learned counsel contended that in the unlikely event that the objection is not sustained, he formulated a sole issue for the determination of the appeal as follows:- Whether on the facts and circumstances of this case, the Court of Appeal was right in holding that an identification parade was not necessary.  Learned counsel contended that assuming, without conceding, that the grounds of appeal and the issue formulated therefrom are competent, then he would answer the sole issue as formulated by him in the affirmative. He referred to the evidence proffered by the prosecution which the trial Court, and the Court below accepted on the PW1s recognition of the appellant as the person he actually saw on that fateful night in their sitting room who was standing between the refrigerator and the wall and who pointed a gun at him and ordered him to switch off the light and to lie down.  He contended that the appellant did not dispute the fact that PW1 had known him and met him from time to time at several places before the incident. Under cross examination from the appellants counsel, PW1 had provided further and better particulars of the circumstances of his knowledge of the appellant. He contended further that PW1, in his testimony had told the Court that he knew the appellant as a close personal friend of Ezeazu, the 1st accused in the original charge who was at large. Indeed, that he had known the appellant long before the incident in issue and gave details of how he had known him. Learned counsel contended that the appellant did not challenge or controvert these pieces of evidence. He referred to page 232 of the Record, on the finding of fact by the trial Court which was accepted by the Court below thereby making it a concurrent finding of fact by the two Courts. Learned counsel contended that it is not in the habit of this Court to lightly interfere with such concurrent findings of fact by the two Courts below except where same is shown to be perverse or to have occasioned a miscarriage of justice to the appellant. He relied on Umar Vs. The State 2014 13 NWLR Pt.1425 497; Anekwe Vs. The State 2014 10 NWLR Pt.1415 353; among others. He submitted that that is not the case of the appellant in the instant appeal. Learned counsel contended that for the concurrent findings of fact of the two Courts below in this case to be said to be perverse, the appellant must show that the same is not based on the evidence adduced before the trial Court or that it is the result of a violation of some principles of law or procedure of the Court. He relied on Emmanuel Egwumi Vs. The State 2013 All FWLR Pt.678 824. He submitted that it is not the case in the instant matter. He referred again to the testimony of PW1 which the appellant did not dispute or controvert and which the two Courts below accepted. He submitted that the concurrent findings of fact by the two Courts below was amply warranted by the evidence, and that the said finding cannot be said to have occasioned a miscarriage of justice. He relied on Oguntayo Vs. Adelaja 2007 All FWLR Pt.495 1626 at 1661; Afolabi & Ors Vs. Western Steel Works Ltd & Ors LPELRÂ 2012Â - 9340Â  SC. 292004.  Learned counsel referred to the Notice and Grounds of Appeal on pages 252 to 254 of the record and submitted that there is no ground of appeal complaining against the specific finding and inference of facts made by the trial Court and accepted by the Court below. He submitted further that the legal consequence of the absence of an appeal against the said concurrent finding and inference of facts of the two Courts below is that both parties have accepted the decision as correct, valid and binding and that neither the appellant nor the respondent can be heard to complain against such holding or finding. He relied onÂ Dabup Vs. Kolo 1993 12 SCNJ 1.  In the light of the above, learned counsel submitted that PW1 having known and met the appellant from time to time on several occasions and at several places before the incident and having recognized him on the night of the murder as the person he had known and met previously, an identification parade in the circumstance would be a mere charade. He submitted that an identification parade is only necessary where the witness did not know the accused person or where he met him for the first time on the day of the incident. He relied onÂ Kabir Almu Vs. The State 2003 7 SC 129; Maikudi Aliyu Vs. The State 2007 All FWLR Pt.388 1123 at 1147.  Learned counsel contended that none of the circumstances necessitating the conduct of an identification parade as laid down by this Court in Kabir Almus case supra is present in the instant case, rather the converse is the case. He submitted that the issue in this case is no longer that of identification but that of recognition of the appellant by PW1 who had known and interacted with him severally prior to the incident hence did not call for an identification parade.  Learned counsel finally urged the Court to discountenance the argument of the appellant and dismiss the appeal for lacking in merit.  The respondents preliminary objection bothers on Ground one of the Notice and Grounds of Appeal to this Court by the appellant. The respondent had contended that Ground one and the issue distilled therefrom are incompetent, not having arisen from the ratio decidendi of the judgment of the Court below. The two grounds of appeal without particulars read thus: Ground One: Error in law - The appellate Court erred in law when it upheld the decision of the trial Court that there was no need for an identification parade in the instant case but that the question that arises therein is whether there was reasonable opportunity for the PW1 to have correctly recognized the person he saw pointing a gun at him in their sitting room that night as the appellant. Ground Two: Misdirection The appellate Court misdirected itself when it held that clearly the trial Courts decision that the appellant did not state what transpired between him and his mother or what he was doing at the material time is in accordance with the law on what constitutes sufficient particulars of an alibi and that evidence of the prosecution which fixed the appellant at the scene of the crime is stronger than the alibi.  The sole issue said to have been distilled from the above two grounds by the appellant goes thus: Whether the Justices of the Court of Appeal were not in error when in upholding the decision of the trial Court, held that identification parade was unnecessary rather the question that arises therein is whether there was reasonable opportunity for PW1 to have correctly recognized the person he saw pointing gun at him in their sitting room that night as the appellant.  In the judgment of the Court below, the Court found that it was the defence, that is, the instant appellant that introduced the evidence of prior contact with PW1 through his cross examination of PW1 which the Court below quoted extensively. From the said evidence of PW1 which the Court below found to have remained unchallenged and uncontroverted, it was further found that the appellant did not in any way dispute the facts alleged therein that PW1 had known the appellant and met him several times at several places before the incident and even knew that he was a close friend of Clement Ezeazu, the co-accused that is at large. The Court below came to the conclusion that it was established by the evidence that the appellant was a person known very well by PW1 before theÂ incident.  The Court below further on page 233 of the record found as follows:- The relevant circumstance here is that PW1 put on the light in the sitting room. PW1 saw the person standing between the fridge and the wall in the sitting room. PW1 who was surprised, thought that the person was his younger brother until he noticed that the person had a gun. The person then pointed the gun in his direction. He recognized the person as the appellant who now asked him to put off the light and PW1 did. It is beyond argument that the person was pointing the gun at PW1 under the brightness of electricity light. It is also obvious that being in the sitting room of a house both met at a close range. The trial Court had held that the fact that both the accused and PW1 were inside the living room indicates that PW1s observation was at a close range.  In the said judgment of the Court below, the Court had come to the conclusion that there was no appeal against the above inference of the trial Court that PW1 had every opportunity to recognize the appellant as a person he had known before the incident in their house. Therefore, if there was no appeal before the Court below on the inference by the trial Court on the sufficient evidence in support of the recognition of the appellant by PW1 then the issue did not arise for determination by the Court below and cannot form part of the decision to be subject of an appeal to this Court.  On page 248 of the record, the Court below had found as follows: The trial Court had held that the piece of evidence that the accused person was seen and recognized by the PW1 at the scene of the murder of the Chief Security Officer in his house is strong, reliable and credible. There is no ground of appeal against this holding. The legal consequence of the absence of an appeal against this decision is that both parties have accepted it as correct. It is therefore valid, subsisting and binding on them.  There is therefore no doubt that, the ground one of the Notice of Appeal filed to this Court not having arisen from the ratio of the Courts decision is incompetent and the issue distilled therefrom also became incompetent and liable to being struck out.  Generally, the ratio decidendi of a case is the principle of law upon which a particular case is decided. Chief Abubakar Z. Odugbo Vs. Chief Ali Abu & Ors 2001 LPELR - 2238 SC.  Since there was no appeal to the Court below on the inferences on the recognition of the appellant by the trial Court, an appeal cannot lie on such inference or reference of the Court below.  There is no gainsaying that the second ground of appeal bothers on or concerns the issue of alibi raised by the appellant but there was no issue distilled from the said ground two. Even though it was linked to the sole issue distilled but it is not related at all. It is settled law that a ground of appeal from which no issue is formulated for determination by the Court is deemed abandoned and liable to being struck out. See; Dalek Nig. Ltd Vs. Oil Mineral Producing Area Dev. Commission OMPADEC 2007 LPELR  916 SC.  Therefore, the two grounds of appeal in this appeal and the sole issue said to have been distilled therefrom are incompetent, liable to being struck out and are accordingly struck out. It is settled law that issues are formulated from grounds of appeal which in turn are founded on the ratio decidendi or reason for decision of the Court in the judgment appealed against. Therefore, if the grounds of appeal and the issue distilled therefrom did not arise from the ratio of the judgment of the Court below, then the said grounds and sole issue are incompetent and are liable to being struck out. That will automatically render the appeal unmeritorious and deserving a dismissal order.  However, assuming without conceding that the grounds of appeal and the sole issue distilled therefrom arose from the judgment of the Court below, I desire to consider the appeal on its merit on the following issue:- Whether in the circumstance of this case, an identification parade was necessary. And whether the defence of alibi was sustainable for the appellant.  First and foremost, it is clear that the appellants defence was an ALIBI. This means when a person charged with an offence says that he was not at the scene of crime at the time the alleged offence was committed. That indeed he was somewhere else and therefore he was not the person who committed the offence. See; Okosi Vs. The State 1989 1 CLRN 29; Akeem Agboola Vs. The State 2013 8 SCM 157; 2013 11 NWLR Pt. 1366 619.  It is trite law, that if an accused person raises unequivocally the issue of alibi, that he was somewhere else other than the locus delicit at the time of the commission of the offence with which he is charged and he gives some facts and circumstances of his whereabout, the prosecution is duty bound to investigate the alibi set up, to verify its truthfulness or otherwise. See; Tirimisiyu Adebayo Vs. The State 2014 12 NWLR Pt.1422 618; 2014 8 SCM 34; 2014 5-6 SC Pt.2 68; 2015 EJSC Vo44 60.  Ordinarily, there is no burden placed on an accused to prove his defence of alibi, but he is certainly not expected to merely state that he was not at the scene of the crime without more. He owes a duty to give or supply the lead and particulars of his whereabout at the earliest opportunity and clearly, which will lead the prosecution in their investigation of the alibi. See; Yanor Vs. State 1965 1 All NLR 193; Ozulonye Vs. State 1981 NCR 38 at 50.  As I stated earlier, the appellants case in defence was that he was not at the scene of the incident with which he was charged. He claimed to be ill and was off duty on that day.  He had to go for treatment with one Mrs. Igboyi  a Nurse, who was working with Bishop Shanahan Hospital Nsukka on the evening of the 26th May, 2002. That after the treatment, he returned to his house and was with his mother until the following morning.  It is however in the testimony of the prosecution that all efforts to investigate the appellants claim failed. The said nurse Mrs. Igboyi who the appellant claimed that he received treatment from did not make herself available. In the same vein, appellants mother failed to show up and did not respond to the invitations left for her in the house, to enable the police confirm the truthfulness or otherwise of the appellants claim to have fallen ill and be in the house on the night of the incident after receiving treatment for his pneumonia. Therefore, if the appellant had said that between the hours of 9pm and 11pm when the incident took place, he was in his house with his mother and the mother failed to respond to the Police invitation for interrogation but the Police already had that the appellant was recognized by an eye witness, as one of the gunmen who had invaded their house and killed their father, the defence of alibi would have been debunked. It is note worthy that the trial Court, on the defence of alibi by the appellant had found that where the prosecution has led strong and credible evidence showing the presence of the accused at the scene of the crime, the identification or recognition of the accused and his participation in the crime will be unimpeachable. See; Madagwa Vs. The State 1988 5 NWLR Pt.92 60 at 62.  In the circumstance, the defence of alibi cannot be sustained in the face of the available evidence of recognition proffered by the prosecution. It shall be discountenanced, and it is hereby discountenanced.  On the issue of an identification parade, the learned counsel for the appellant had contended that the instant case was an ideal situation when the police ought to have conducted an identification parade.  What then is an identification parade? It is an identification procedure of the police, in which a criminal suspect and other physically similar persons are shown to the victim or witness to determine whether the suspect can be identified as the perpetrator or one of the perpetrators of the crime. It is otherwise called and referred to as line up.  It is trite law that an identification parade is not a sine qua non for identification in all cases where there have been a fleeting encounter with the victim of a crime, if there is yet other pieces of evidence leading conclusively to the identity of the perpetrator of the offence.  Therefore, an identification parade will only become necessary where the victim of the crime did not know the accused before his acquaintance with him during the commission of the offence.  The law is also settled that an identification parade is very essential and useful whenever there is doubt as to the ability of a victim to recognize the suspect who participated in carrying out the crime or where the identity of the said suspect or accused person is in dispute. But where there is certainty or no dispute as to the identity of the perpetrator of a crime, there will be no need for an identification parade. See; R vs TurnbulÂ 1976 3 All ER 549; 1977 QB 224 at 228, 234; Ikemson Vs. State 1989 1 CLRN 1; Adebayo Vs. The State supra.  Furthermore, it has been held that an identification parade will be necessary only in the following circumstances: a Where the victim or witness did not know the accused before and the first acquaintance with him is during the commission of the offence; b Where the victim or witness was confronted by the suspect for a very short time; and c Where the victim or witness, due to time and circumstance might not have had the opportunity of observing the features of the accused. See; Kabir Almu Vs. The State 2003 7 SC 129.  On the record and from the evidence available, PW1 testified that he had known the appellant a long time ago and had met him from time to time on several occasions and at several places before the incident in their house. Also, the evidence showed that the confrontation with the appellant by PW1 was prolonged and they were face to face, in the full glare of electricity light before PW1 was ordered to put the light off. The trial Court was therefore right to have come to the conclusion that the appellant was correctly recognized by PW1, hence there was no need for an identification parade to further identify him.  As earlier stated, it is clear from the record that the appellant did not appeal to the Court below on the findings and inferences of his detailed recognition by PW1, hence there was nothing on that issue in the judgment of the Court below to appeal against.  However, before I conclude this judgment, I feel compelled to comment on the incident at the commencement of the proceedings before the trial Court of Enugu State. It is on record that the appellant and one other  as the 1st accused had been arraigned for trial, charged with conspiracy and murder. After their pleas were taken and each pleaded not guilty, the matter was adjourned for hearing. The then 1st accused later took an application to a vacation Judge in Enugu for his bail pending trial. The vacation Judge granted him bail on N250,000.00. He was reported to have jumped the bail and the surety readily paid the sum of N250,000.00, the bail money in lieu and he was never available to stand the trial. He is reported to remain at large.  There is no doubt that granting or refusal of bail application is at the discretion of the Judge who is considering the application. Yet, there are a number of factors or criteria that must be taken into consideration by the Judge in granting or refusing bail pending trial. These include: 1 The nature of the offence and the punishment attached to it, if proved 2 the evidence available against the accused; 3 availability of the accused to stand trial 4 the likelihood of the accused committing another offence while on bail; 5 the likelihood of the accused interfering with the cause of justice; 6 the criminal antecedents of the accused person; 7 the likelihood of further charge being brought against the accused; 8 the probability of guilt; 9 detention for the protection of the accused; 10 the necessity to procure medical or social report pending final disposal of the case. Certainly these are some of the factors that may be taken into consideration and by no means exhaustive. See; Bamaiyi Vs. The State & Ors 2001 LPELR - 731 8. I have no doubt in my mind that the said vacation Judge disregarded all the above factors to be considered.  In this case, the offence charged included murder punishable with death sentence. The proof of evidence showed incriminating materials, recovered from the accused persons house upon execution of search warrant on the house. With the available evidence, it baffles one to hear that the vacation Judge, not the Judge whose Court was to try the case, considered the bail and readily granted same. I believe that when the accused later jumped bail and he refused to make himself available for his trial, the Judge should have realized that he has to cover his face in shame for his failure to exercise his discretion on the bail application, both judicially and judiciously. Ordinarily, Judges should be above board as far as integrity and competence are concerned.  It is rather unfortunate, to say the least, that a man who was alleged to be involved in the gruesome murder of the Chief Security Officer of the University and serial raping of the two grown up daughters of the deceased can be carelessly allowed to escape from justice. I shall say nothing more on this and let the conscience of the said Judge continue to deal with him either in his retirement or still in service. He is however not on trial.  In the final analysis, this appeal is lacking in merit and substance. It is liable to being dismissed. Accordingly, it is hereby dismissed. The conviction and sentence of the appellant by the trial Court on 31st March, 2008 which was affirmed by the Court below on 20th December, 2018 is affirmed.  Appeal dismissed.   KUDIRAT MOTONMORI OLATOKUNBO KEKERE-EKUN, J.S.C.:  I have read in draft the judgment of my learned brother, Olukayode Ariwoola, JSC, just delivered. I agree entirely with the reasoning and conclusion that the appeal lacks merit and should be dismissed.  The pathetic facts that led to the callous and gruesome murder of the deceased have been adequately summarized in the lead judgment. It is not necessary to repeat them. My brief comments are in respect of the appellant's contention that having regard to the facts of this case, an identification parade ought to have been conducted by the Police to ascertain that the appellant was the person who committed the offence.  It has been held severally by this Court that whether or not it is necessary to conduct an identification parade depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. An identification parade is only necessary when there is doubt as to the ability of a victim to recognize the suspect who carried out or participated in the commission of the crime, or where the identity of the suspect is in dispute. See: Alufohai Vs The State 2015 3 NWLR pt. 1445 172; Ogoala Vs The State 1991 LPELR - 2307 SC @ 13 A - B. Even when there has only been a fleeting encounter with the suspect, it is not in every case that an identification parade would be necessary, particularly where there are other pieces of evidence that lead conclusively to the suspect as the perpetrator of the offence. See: Adebayo Vs The State 2014 LPELR - 22988 SC @ 36- 37 E-C.  PW1, in his testimony before the Court gave a detailed account of all that transpired the day his father was murdered and his encounter with the appellant. It is significant to note that PW1's father was the head of security at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and PW1 testified that he knew the appellant as one of the security guards who worked under him. The incident occurred in May 2002. Under cross examination, PW1 stated that he got to know the appellant during a security exercise at the university in 2001. He also stated that he had seen the appellant several times within the university campus, along the road and in the market. He was familiar with him although he did not know his name. He testified that he gave a description to the police and got to know his name later, after he had made his statement to the Police. As rightly observed by the learned Justices of the lower Court, PW1's evidence was unchallenged and uncontradicted.  It was therefore clear, as held by the Court below, that the need to conduct an identification parade did not arise, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case.  For these and the more detailed reasoning in the lead judgment, I find no merit in the appeal. It is hereby dismissed. The judgment of the lower Court is affirmed.   AMINA ADAMU AUGIE, J.S.C.:  I had a preview of the lead Judgment delivered by my learned brother, Ariwoola, JSC, and I agree with him that this Appeal lacks merit and must be dismissed.  It is settled that an identification parade is not necessary where there is other evidence leading conclusively to the identity of the perpetrators of the offence - SeeÂ Ikemson v. State1989 3 NWLR Pt. 110 455 SC, wherein this Court held that an identification parade is only essential in the followingÂ situations: - Where the victim of the crime did not know the Accused before; - Where the victim was confronted by the offender for a very short time; and - Where the victim, due to time and circumstances, might not have had the opportunity of observing the features of the Accused Person.  The essence of an identification parade is, therefore, to enable an eye witness, who never knew the person accused of the crime before, to pick him out from amongst other people - See Adebayo v. State 2014 LPELR- 22988 SC. See also the case of Alufohai v. The State 2014 LPELR- 24215 SC, wherein my learned brother, Ariwoola, JSC, explained the rationale as follows -  It is trite law that identification parade is only necessary whenever there is doubt as to the ability of a victim to recognize the suspect, who carried out or participated in carrying out the crime alleged or where the identity of the said suspect or an Accused Person is in dispute. But where there is certainty or no dispute as to the identity of the perpetrator of a crime, there will be no need for an identification parade to further identify the offender.  So, anÂ identification parade becomes necessary when there is a need to establish the identity of a suspect. But there are many cases where an identification parade is of no use; such as when the suspect is arrested at the scene of the crime; when the suspect is well-known to the victim or witness; and when evidence adduced is sufficient to establish that the suspect is the person that committed the crime - See Moses Jua v. State 2010 4 NWLR Pt. 1154 217 SC, Bassey Akpan Archibong v. State 2006 14 NWLR Pt. 1000 349 SC and Theophilus Eyisi Alias Sunday Eyisi & 2 Ors v. State 2000 15 NWLR Pt.691 555 SC.  In this case, the trial Court believed and accepted the evidence of PW1 that he recognized the Appellant, whom he knew before, as the person, who pointed the gun at him when he walked into the sitting room that night and put on the light, and there was, therefore, no need to conduct an identification parade in this case.  It is for this and the other reasons in the lead Judgment that I also dismiss this Appeal for lacking in merit and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeal.   PAUL ADAMU GALUMJE, J.S.C.:  I have had the privilege of reading in draft the judgment of my learned brother, OLUKAYODE ARIWOOLA, JSC just delivered. I agree with his reasoning and conclusion that the appeal lacks merit and should be dismissed. Accordingly I join my brother in dismissing it. The judgment of the lower Court is hereby affirmed.   UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI, J.S.C.:  I have had a preview of the reasons for judgment given by my learned brother, Ariwoola, JSC, in the lead judgment. I agree entirely with the reasoning and conclusions reached therein that the appeal be dismissed.  Heavy weather has been made of the fact that the prosecution did not conduct an identification parade to ascertain the true identity of the Appellant to the murder of the deceased.  Identification parade is not the only way of establishing the identification of an accused person in relation to the offence charged. Where the witness has ample opportunity to identify the accused, a parade is not necessary. See Per BAGE, JSC inÂ KEKONG v. STATE 2017 LPELR- 42343 SC. Identification parade is not therefore a sine qua non to a conviction. It has to be established or proved that the accused is guilty of the offence he is being charged with, beyond reasonable doubt. In the present appeal, the evidence of PW1 sufficed to link the Appellant to the murder of the deceased and to establish his culpability. Also, PW1 has satisfied that he very well knew the Appellant before the gruesome murder.  I have nothing more to add than to say may God lead the Appellant to repentance and have mercy on him for the murder and rapes he committed.-end!" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  ITA GEORGE MBABA, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  This Appeal emanated from the decision of Imo State High Court in Suit No.HOU30CM2018, delivered on 15th October 2018, wherein the trial Court held that the power of the fiat dated 2352018, obtained by the Appellants Counsel to prosecute the charge MUB6C2018 at the Magistrates Court, against the Respondent Anayo Ugwumba did not extend to the power to appear before the High Court in the application to seek the bail of the Respondent.  A brief facts of the case shows that the Respondent had been charged before the Magistrates Court, Ubulu in Oru-West L.G.A of Imo State in a holding Charge for murder, sometime in April 2018. Because the Learned Magistrate had no jurisdiction to take the trial, it ordered the remand of the Respondent in the Prison, and for the case file to be sent to the Director Public Prosecution DPP, for advicefurther action. That was on 8518 and the case was adjourned to 1152018 for report See pages 8 to 11 of the Records of Appeal. While the order of the said Magistrates Court, was pending, the learned Attorney General of Imo State issued a fiat to K.A. Nwakuche Esq a private Legal Practitioner, on 2352018, to prosecute the case for the Commissioner of Police COP in the charge No MUB6C2018. See the supplementary Records of Appeal, transmitted to this Court on 3052019.  While awaiting the further action or advice of the D.P.P., the Respondents Counsel applied to the High Court, for the bail of the Respondent, on 762018. The Respondents Counsel, B.O. Mgbenulu Esq who appeared for the Respondent at the Magistrate Court, however, opposed the appearance of K.A. Nwakuche Esq for the Commissioner of Police Appellant at the High Court, saying that the fiat issued to the Appellants Counsel by the Hon. Attorney General was to prosecute the charge at the Magistrates Court and did not extend to prosecute this case in the High Court; that the fiat was in respect of the matter at the Magistrates Court in Charge No MUB6C2018.  Holding on the objection, the trial Court refused the appearance of K.A. Nwackuche Esq for the Commissioner of Police Appellant herein and said: The fiat to prosecute a case is given by the Attorney General after the office would have initiated the criminal charge. This is necessary because the particulars indicated on the face of the fiat to include the Charge Number, names of the accused person, the conditions attached to the fiat. There is no evidence placed before this Court to show that the Attorney General has issued any fiat to K.A. Nwakuche to prosecute any criminal charge in this Court. This fiat is akin to power of Attorney donated by a donor to the donee. The donee cannot in the exercise of the power of attorney go beyond the express powers conferred on him by the donor. By the tenor of this FIAT, issued to K.A. Nwakuche Esq, the best he could have done in the circumstances of this case would have been to report to the Honourable Attorney General, in writing, stating the fact that the Magistrates Court declined jurisdiction to entertain this case being a murder charge and has transferred the case file to the State D.P.P. for further legal action.  This would have enabled the Honourable Attorney General to have the benefit of the state of the case and will also guide him in deciding whether to validate the FIAT, or take over the prosecution of the case himself, or delegate any of the law officers in his chambers or issue another fiat to another private practitioner to prosecute the accused person. See page 54 55 of the Records of Appeal.  This is the decision Appellant appealed against, as per the Notice of Appeal, filed on 31102018, on pages 56 to 58 of the Records of Appeal. Appellant filed Brief of arguments on 14112018 and distilled 2 issues for the determination of the Appeal, namely: 1 Whether the trial Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the objection to the appearance of a private Legal Practitioner with a fiat before him sic? Ground 1 2 Whether the trial Court was right when he sic came to the conclusion that the ProsecAutor needed re-validation of fiat and evidence to show he had the authority of the Attorney General to prosecute a criminal charge before him sic? Grounds 2 and 3.  The Respondent filed his brief on 1532019, which was deemed duly filed on 1832019. He adopted the issues as distilled by the Appellant but, rephrased the issue 1 to read. Whether the trial Court was right to hear and determine the objection raised as to the appearance of a private legal practitioner without a fiat before him sic in a criminal case?  Arguing the Appeal, on 2912020, Appellants Counsel, on issue one, said that, where issue of jurisdiction succeeds, the case ends See Lakanmi Vs Adene 2003 10 NWLR Pt.828 353; Utih Vs Onoyivwe 19911 NWLR Pt.166 166 at 206 - that jurisdiction, is the blood that gives life to the survival of an action in Court. Counsel said the trial Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the objection to the appearance of K.A. Nwakuche Esq, who appeared with a fiat of the Attorney General AG of Imo State to prosecute Anayo Ugwumba for murder in Charge No. MUB6C2018. That, he said, is because enquiries by Courts into the appearance of a legal practitioner, to represent a party, have always been condemned by this Court and the Supreme Court. He relied on Adewunmi Vs Plastex Nig Ltd 1986 3 NWLR Pt.32 767, Tukur Vs Gov. of Gongola State 1989 4 NWLR Pt.117517.  Counsel said that a Court has no business to enquire into the authority of a counsel to appear in a matter, with or without a fiat.  He urged us to answer the issue in the negative.  On issue 2, whether the trial Court was right to say that the Prosecution needed re-validation of the fiat andor evidence to show that he had authority of the A.G. to prosecute the criminal charge in the High Court, Counsel answered in the negative. He said that the A.G. of Imo State did not need to issue a fresh fiat before the Prosecutor could appear before the lower Court to oppose the bail application; that the authorities which the Respondent relied on to seek renewal of the fiat were misconceived. He relied on C.O.P. Vs Ayi 2005 All FWLR Pt.286 679, which he said was brought to the attention of the trial Court, but it still went on a voyage canvassing other issues, not germane to the determination of the matter before it. Counsel said those issues raked up by the trial Court were completely uncalled for and irrelevant, considering the fact that the fiat issued on 2352018 was to prosecute the case of C.O.P. Vs Anayo Ugumba, simpliciter, and the bail application filed by the Respondent was sequel to the bail not granted him at the Magistrates Court; that the appearance to oppose the application for bail was a continuation of the same prosecution of the Criminal Charge No.MUB6C2018.  Counsel said the Supreme Court had laid to rest the issue of fresh fiat, from Magistrate Courts to High Court or to Court of Appeal; that no fresh fiat is needed by a Counsel to travel from one Court to the other, particularly, where and when it is in respect of the same matter. He relied on the case of Ebe Vs C.O.P. 2008 All FWLR Pt.406 1849, where it was held: Once a fiat is granted to a Counsel to prosecute or defend a case, the validity of the fiat would continue throughout the duration of the case for which the fiat was granted.  Counsel also relied on Marcel Nnakwe Vs State 2013 Vol. 223 LRCN Pt.11 at 49: As rightly submitted by the learned Respondents Counsel, the situation at hand did not require the Attorney General of the Federation to issue a fresh fiat before the law firm of Chief Afe Babalola, SAN & Co could proceed with the prosecution of the appeals arising from the charge.  Counsel also referred us to the admonition of the Supreme Court in the case of Adamu Suleman & Anor. Vs C.O.P. 2008 8 NWLR Pt.1089 298 at 332, that judges should not give judgments based on sentiments or on their whims and caprices. He said that trial Court was on a frolic, and had ignored known legal principles. He urged us to resolve the issues for Appellant and allow the Appeal.  Counsel for Respondent, B.O. Mgbeanulu; Esq, answered the issue one in the affirmative, saying that the trial Court was right to refuse the appearance of K.A. Nwakuche Esq in the bail application, as there was no fiat authorising him to prosecuteor file a counter affidavit to the bail application.  On issue 2, Respondents Counsel also answered in the affirmative. He said that Appellants counsel needed re-validation of the fiat and evidence to show that he had authority to prosecute the charge. He argued that what was before the trial Court was not an appeal emanating from the Charge  MUB6C2018, for which Appellants counsel was issued a fiat to prosecute but a bail application which was filed and hinged upon the failure of the Attorney General to file information against the Respondent. Counsel said it is a misconception of the law, to say that A.G. of Imo State does not need to issue a fresh fiat to the Appellant Counsel to oppose the application for bail. He argued that the cases of Ebe Vs Commissioner of Police 2008 All FWLR Pt.406; C.O.P. Vs Ayi & Ors 2005 All FWLR Pt.286 679; Adewunmi Vs Plastex Nig. Ltd 19863 NWLR Pt.32 767 and Tukur Vs Gov. of Gongola State supra relied upon by Appellant, are distinguishable from this case at hand. He urged us to dismiss the Appeal.  RESOLUTION OF THE ISSUES I shall resolve this Appeal on the two issues donated by the Appellant, which were adopted by the Respondent, with slight modification. I shall however, take the two issues together, as they all question the jurisdiction and decision of the trial Court to refuse the Appellants Counsel to appear for Appellant in the bail application on the basis of the fiat he obtained to prosecute the case.  It is pertinent to observe that the trial Court did actually acknowledge and admit that Appellants Counsel, K.A. Nwakuche Esq, had a fiat to prosecute the case  C.O.P. Vs Anayo Ugwumba MOU6C2018 at the Magistrates Court. It rather sought Appellants Counsel to obtain a fresh fiat, or get the fiat re-validated before appearing at the High Court. The learned trial Court did not however, state when the fiat given to Appellants Counsel to prosecute the case, became invalid or out dated, to require re-validation or a fresh fiat.  I think the learned trial Court was in grave error, when it allowed the Respondents Counsel to mislead it into thinking that a Counsel who enjoys a fiat from Attorney General to prosecute a chargecase at the Magistrates Court, needs a fresh fiat to continue to represent the party Appellant at the High Court for the purpose of opposing application for the bail of the accused person Respondent, or for the purpose of appeal against the decision of the Magistrate in the said casecharge. The decisions of this Court and of the Apex Court on this issue are replete, and the trial Court even had the privilege of being referred to some. For instance, the case of Ebe Vs Commissioner of Police 2008 All FWLR Pt.406; C.O.P. Vs Ayi & Ors 2005 All FWLR Pt.286 679; Adewunmi Vs Plastex Nig. Ltd 19863 NWLR Pt.32 767 and Tukur Vs Gov. of Gongola State supra, were all brought to the attention of the learned trial Court. See page 49 of the Records of Appeal.  In that case of Ebe Vs C.O.P. supra the Supreme Court, on the lifespan of a fiat said: once a fiat is granted to a Counsel to prosecute or defend a case, the validity of the fiat would continue throughout the duration of the case for which the fiat was granted. Per Akintan JSC.  In that case, Mohammad JSC, on the meaning of a fiat and its lifespan, said: On the issue of expiration of fiat raised by the Appellants Counsel, the learned counsel should appreciate the connotation and efficacy of a fiat. Firstly, it is a Latin word which means, Let is be done. Technically, therefore, it denotes the grant or conferment of power on another, by a person having complete authority on the issue upon which the fiat was given. In matters of prosecution, the Attorney General of State or of the Federation can give such a fiat. A Commissioner of Police can delegate his officers or private legal practitioners to represent him in a case. The lifespan of such an authority or fiat may extend to the conclusion of the case in question.  And in the case of C.O.P. Vs Ayi & Ors 2005 All FWLR Pt.286 679, the Supreme Court said: Lastly on the issue 1, the fiat stated was not necessary to re-validate same from the Attorney General before he could appear and appeal to the High Court.  And in Marcel Nnakwe Vs State 2013 1 at 49 the Supreme Court, per Ogunbiyi JSC said: As rightly submitted by the learned Respondents Counsel, the situation at hand did not require the Attorney General of the Federation to issue a fresh fiat before the law firm of Chief Afe Babalola SAN & Co. could proceed with the prosecution of the appeals arising from the charge. The learned Appellants Counsel, with respect, I hold, got it all wrong and was grossly misconceived. This is more so with the present appeal being interlocutory, the main case is therefore still pending at the trial Court; hence the extant conclusive notion held that the case for which fiat was issued is still pending and the need for a fresh fiat, does not, in the circumstance, arise. The Law Firm of Afe Babalola & Co. SAN, in other words, needs no fresh fiat to prosecute any appeal arising from the charge.  That case of Marcel Nnakwe Vs State supra has much in common with the case, at hand, whereof the real issue in contention is not also about the substantive charge or trial thereof, which is yet to commence. What is in issue is application for the bail of the accused person, following the order for his remand in prison by the learned Magistrate, who had no jurisdiction to try the accused person for murder, but sent his case file to the DPP for further action possible arraignment of the accused in the High Court.  What is surprising to me is the fact that the Respondents Counsel, who should have been interested in the speedy determination of the bail application, in the interest of his client Accused person, is the person stalling the determination of the bail application, by opposing the appearance of the Appellants Counsel to oppose the bail application. Meanwhile, the Respondent, who was ordered to be remanded in the prison custody by the Magistrate, since 452018 And even before the arraignment on 4518, he had been in Police Custody, having been arrested since 112018  pages of the Records of Appeal. The Respondent has therefore, been languishing in the prison, with no obvious hope of quick reprieve, as long as the bail application is stalled, andor the DPP is yet to come up with a decision, whether to try him or let him out. The style and procedure adopted by the Respondents Counsel, in my view, rather appears to hurt his clients interest more.  There is no way it can be argued that the application for the bail of the Respondent was not an offshoot of the order of the learned Magistrate, remanding the Respondent in Charge No MUB6C2018; and that the Appellants Counsel was still exercising his mandate in the fiat, to prosecute the Respondent in Charge MUB6C2018, which is still pending waiting for the advicedecision of the DPP in the matter. The fiat donated to the Appellants Counsel by the learned Attorney General of Imo State on 2352018, stated as follows: Charge No MUB6C2018 COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VS ANAYO UGWUMBA AUTHORITY TO PROSECUTE In exercise of the Powers conferred on me by Section 781 of the Magistrate Courts Law, Cap. 82, Laws of Eastern Nigeria, 1963,  applicable to Imo State and of all other powers enabling me on that behalf I, MILETUS O. NLEMEDIM ESQ; Attorney General of Imo State of Nigeria, DO HEREBY AUTHORIZE K.A. NWAKUCHE ESQ Solicitor and Advocates of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, to prosecute the case of COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VS ANAYO UGWUMBA CHARGE NO: MUB6C2018 It is hereby specifically provided that the Authority includes the Power to amend andor add to the charge, if necessary, but does not include the Power to add to the number of accused persons. It is further provided that the Prosecuting Counsel shall give the Honourable Attorney General a written brief on the stages of position of the case, bi-monthly andor at any time it may be so required.  The above clearly spelt out the scope of the powers granted to Nwakuche Esq to prosecute the accused person  Anayo Ugwumba in the Charge, and it ensured that the prosecuting Counsel maintained constant touch with the Attorney General by briefing the A.G., every two weeks or as required on the progress of the prosecution. It should also be noted that the fiat was issued on 2352018, after the arraignment of the Respondent and order of rem and of Respondent on 852018.  The Bail Application, as earlier stated, was an off shoot of the matter in the charge No. MUB6C2018, and, in fact, carried the said charge Number and the parties: Commissioner of Police Vs Anayo Ugwumba. There is nothing in the application to suggest that the Hon. Attorney General was left in the dark about the progress of the case and the step Appellants counsel was taking to oppose the bail application.  It, therefore did not lie with Respondent's Counsel nor with the lower Court, hearing the bail application, to determine the validity of the fiat given to the Appellants Counsel, and to order Appellants Counsel to go for re-validation or renewal of the fiat, as the same was still subsisting and valid.  The lower Court had no business to consider the validity of the fiat at all, and it strayed outside its jurisdiction when it wasted its time and energy to consider the Fiat, rather that what was before it, the Bail Application. That was a misadventure and distraction which a Court is barred from undertaking. Lawal Vs Eleko & Ors 2010 LPELR  4426 CA; Usman Vs FRN 2015 LPELR  40584 CA; Obi Vs The A.G. Imo State 2014 LPELR  24280 CA  A Judge must not be seen to descend into the arena of conflict in a trial to generate evidence or fact not canvassed or adduced by witnesses or apparent on the face of the records before him, to decide a case, Ayoade Vs Spring Bank Plc Pt.139693.  I think a Court cannot question a fiat given to a Counsel to prosecute a case. See The State Vs Ughanwa & Ors 2019 LPELR  48868 CA; Nnakwe Vs State 201318 NWLR Pt.13851; Ebe Vs COP 2008 4 NWLR Pt.1076 189; Ogboru & Anor Vs Uduaghan & Ors 2013 LPELR  20805 SC.  In the case of Zakirai Vs Muhammad 2017 LPELR  42349 SC at 12  13, the Supreme Court held: To start with, the issue of representation by Counsel is a matter of Counsel-client relationship, which this Court cannot get involved in  See the case of Chief MKO Abiola Vs FRN 1996 LPELR  40 SC.  See also Ahanonu Vs Chukwuemezie 2015 LPELR  40997 CA, it was held: Where Counsel files processes and proceeds to announce himself in Court as appearing for the appellant or the respondent, the Court will presume that he is fully briefed to appear and therefore cannot turn round to complain of denial of personal representation of his client again.  In the case of Akalonu Vs Omokaro 2002 LPELR  7131 CA, this Court said: it does not lie with the Appellant in the instant appeal to question the instruction or extent of the instruction of the learned counsel for respondent when a counsel appears in Court and states that he is instructed, the Court will not inquire into his authority to appear. Allen Vs Francis 1914 3 KB 1065. See also Tukur Vs Government of Gongola State 19881 NWLR Pt.6839, where it was held:  Courts usually and normally take Counsels word for it, when Counsel announces that he is appearing for a client. The Courts do not require Counsel to tender written evidence to prove that he had been so briefed. It will be a sad day for legal profession in Nigeria when Counsel can no longer be believed that he is appearing for a client and it does not matter if that client is a State Government when Counsel appears in Court and states that he is instructed, the Court will not inquire into his authority to appear See also FRN Vs Alioha & Ors 2016 LPELR  40940 CA.  I see merit in this appeal and so resolve the issues for the Appellant and allow the Appeal. The decision of the trial Court in HOU30CM2018 is hereby set aside, and the case remitted to the Learned Chief Judge of Imo State to be assigned to another Judge, to take the Bail Application. Parties to bear their Respective costs.   AYOBODE OLUJIMI LOKULO-SODIPE, J.C.A.:  I agree.   IBRAHIM ALI ANDENYANGTSO, J.C.A.:  I agree.-end!" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary " The Respondent had been charged before the Magistrates Court, Ubulu in Oru-West L.G.A of Imo State (in a holding Charge) for murder, sometime in April 2018. Because the Learned Magistrate had no jurisdiction to take the trial, it ordered the remand of the Respondent in the Prison, and for the case file to be sent to the Director Public Prosecution (DPP), for advice/further action. While the order of the said Magistrates Court, was pending, the Attorney General of Imo State issued a fiat to a private Legal Practitioner), on 23/5/2018, to prosecute the case for the Commissioner of Police (COP).  While awaiting the further action or advice of the D.P.P., the Respondents Counsel applied to the High Court, for the bail of the Respondent, on 7/6/2018. The Respondents Counsel, B.O. Mgbenulu Esq (who appeared for the Respondent at the Magistrate Court), however, opposed the appearance of K.A. Nwakuche Esq for the Commissioner of Police (Appellant) at the High Court, saying that the fiat issued to the Appellants Counsel by the Hon. Attorney General was to prosecute the charge at the Magistrates Court and did not extend to prosecute this case in the High Court; that the fiat was in respect of the matter at the Magistrates Court in Charge No MUB/6C/2018.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  UGOCHUKWU ANTHONY OGAKWU, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  The parties in this appeal are scions from the loins of the late Paul Dawson Otigbah. He sired them from two different women. The Appellants and the 2nd Respondent are children of the same mother while the 1st Respondent has a different mother. The common denominator between the parties is their late father. The root of the contest in this appeal is the property left behind by their father. The property is situate at No 3 Otigbah Street, Ikeja, Lagos. In his lifetime, their father by a Deed of Assignment dated 2nd June, 1977 assigned the said property to his children, the parties herein, out of love, bond and affection. The said Deed of Assignment was admitted at the trial as Exhibit C1. Subsequently, a Deed of Partition was executed between the 1st Respondent and the 2nd Respondent partitioning the property. The Deed of Partition is Exhibit C2. There is also a Development Lease by which the 1st Respondent was to develop and take control of the property. The Development Lease is Exhibit C3. The Deed of Partition and the Development Lease are both dated 23rd June 2008. Furthermore, there is a Purchase Agreement, it is between the original owners of the land and the 1st Respondent. It is dated 10th February, 1977. By the said Purchase Agreement, the property was sold to the 1st Respondent as the outright sole owner of the property. It is Exhibit D6 in this matter.  Now, the Appellants contending that the Deed of Partition and Development Lease Agreement are illegal and that the 1st Respondent had failed to give an account of rents collected from the tenants at the property instituted proceedings before the High Court of Lagos State in SUIT NO. ID11742011: MAUREEN OTIGBAH & ORS vs. AGATHA ADETUTU UWANAKA nee OTIGBAH & ANOR. wherein they claimed the following reliefs: “1. A DECLARATION that the purported Deed of Partition between Mrs. Agatha Adetutu Uwanaka Nee Otigbah and George Ifeanyi Otigbah dated 23rd June, 2008 is illegal, unlawful, null, void and of no legal effect. 2. A DECLARATION that the purported Development AgreementLease between George Ifeanyi Otigbah and Mrs. Agatha Adetutu Uwanaka Nee Otigbah purportedly signed on 3rd April, 2009 is illegal, unlawful, null, void and of no legal effect. 3. A DECLARATION that by virtue of the Deed of Assignment dated 2nd June, 1977 between Paul Dawson Otigbah and Agatha Adetutu Otigbah for herself and other children of the Assignor registered as No. 55 Page 55 in Volume 1627 of the Lagos State of Nigeria Land Registry, Ikeja, Lagos, the Claimants and the Defendants are joint owners on equal basis of 3, Otigbah Street, Ikeja., Lagos. 4. AN ORDER permanently restraining the Defendants from giving effect to the purported deed of partition between Agatha Adetutu Nwanaka Nee Otigbah and George Ifeanyi Otigbah dated 23rd June, 2008. 5. AN ORDER setting aside the said Deed of Partition and the Development AgreementLease entered into between the 1st Defendant and the 2nd Defendant. 6. AN ORDER directing the 1st Defendant to give account of all proceeds of rent collected by her from inception till the final determination of the suit. 7. AN ORDER compelling the 1st Defendant to pay over to the Claimants all funds due to them as joint owners of the property in dispute.”  The 1st Respondent set up a counter-claim and she claimed the following reliefs: “1. A DECLARATION that what the late Pa Dawson transferred to his children was his unexpired residue in the leasehold of and the 1st defendant having converted it to a freehold by buying the said property in dispute, she is now the owner of the said property and can partition, develop, lease and do with it as she pleases. 2. A DECLARATION that the said Deed of Partition and Development AgreementLease is legal and valid and should stand as per terms in it. 3. The sum of One Million Naira N1,000,000 being the cost and Professional fees for this Litigation be charged against the Estate.”  The matter was subjected to a full dressed hearing at which testimonial and documentary evidence was adduced by the parties. In its judgment delivered on 30th June, 2015, the Lower Court dismissed the Appellants’ case and entered judgment for the 1st Respondent in terms of her counterclaim.   The Appellants being dissatisfied with the said judgment appealed against the same by Notice of Appeal filed on 22nd July, 2015. The judgment of the Lower Court is at pages 508-524 of the Records while the Notice of Appeal is at pages 525-537 of the Records. The 1st Respondent filed a Notice of Contention that the judgment of the Lower Court be affirmed on grounds other than those relied on by the Lower Court. The said Notice of Contention which was filed on 24th August, 2015 is at pages 538-539 of the Records. The Records of Appeal was compiled and transmitted and the Appellants filed their brief of argument on 7th September, 2016 but deemed as properly filed on 16th January, 2019. The Respondents did not file any brief of argument and even though all the processes were served on them, they also did not attend Court at the hearing. The appeal was consequently heard on the Appellants’ brief alone, which brief the learned counsel for the Appellants adopted and relied upon at the hearing of the appeal.  The Appellants nominated three issues for determination as follows: “1. Whether the Lower Court, having found that the Appellants and the Respondents were joint owners of the leasehold interest in No. 3, Otigba Street, Ikeja, Lagos as per Exhibit C1, was not wrong in refusing to grant the order directing the 1st DefendantRespondent to render account of the rents collected by her in respect of the said property to the other co-owners see Grounds 1, 2 and 7. 2. Whether the lower Court was right in holding that the Deed of Partition and the Development Agreement made between the 1st and 2nd DefendantRespondents were legal and valid in law and not liable to be set aside see Grounds 6 and 8 3. Whether the lower Court was right in holding that the 1st DefendantRespondent had become the sole owner of No. 3 Otigba Street, Ikeja, Lagos by virtue of the purchase receipts dated 6th March, 1996, 2nd October, 1996 and the Purchase Agreement dated 10th February, 1977 see Ground 3, 4, 5.”  I will review the submissions of the Appellants’ counsel and thereafter resolve the appeal seamlessly en bloc.  SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANTS’ COUNSEL The Appellants submit on the first issue that the Lower Court having held that the parties were joint owners of the property was wrong to have refused the order directing the 1st Respondent to render an account of the rents collected as she was the one managing the property and collecting rent from the tenants at the property. It was opined that the 1st Respondent was in the position of a trustee, since their father assigned the property to her on behalf of and for the benefit of all his children vide IWOK vs. UNIVERSITY OF UYO 2011 6 NWLR PT 1243 211 at 236, JOLUGBO vs. AINA 2016 LPELR 40352 CA, NBN vs. SAVOL W.

It was maintained that the 1st Respondent, as trustee had a duty to render account of her management of the property and that the 1st Respondent’s evidence on having spent money on the upkeep and education of some of the Appellants does not amount to rendering an account. The cases of A-G BENDEL STATE vs. A-G FEDERATION 1983 ALL NLR 208 at 225, A-G FEDERATION vs. A-G ABIA STATE NO. 2 2002 6 NWLR PT. 764 542 at 672, ADEKEYE vs. AKIN-OLUGBADE supra at 228-229, OLUFON vs. HADAEMEC LTD 2001 FWLR PT 33 208 at 216 and ANYAORAH vs. ANYAORAH 2001 7 NWLR PT 711 158 at 179-180 were referred to on the duty of a trustee to render account.  On the second issue, the Appellants submit that their interest in the property with the 1st Respondent was joint and that the 1st Respondent cannot claim 50% of the property while the 2nd Respondent and the Appellants would collectively have the remaining 50%. The joint ownership, it was asserted, implied that the parties have the same right and equal share over the property. The cases of OSUJI vs. EKEOCHA 2009 16 NWLR PT. 1166 81 at 128 and OBASOHAN vs. OMORODION 2001 13 NWLR PT. 729 206 at 222 were relied upon. The Appellants posit that being jointly owned, the property could only be partitioned with the consent and approval of all the joint owners and shared equally or where equal sharing cannot be achieved, monetary compensation of equal value of the land will be paid to the co-owners. The cases of BARUWA vs. OSOBA 1997 3 NWLR PT 492 164 at 176-177 and 181 and ODEKILEKUN vs. HASSAN 1997 12 NWLR PT 531 56 at 74-75 were cited in support.  It is the further contention of the Appellants that the 1st Respondent being a trustee cannot turn herself into a developer of the trust property since a trustee should not place herself in a situation where her personal interest and her trusteeship duties may possibly conflict. The cases of BRAY vs. FORD 1896 AC 44, BOARDMAN vs. PHIPPS 1967 2 AC 46 and ”Cases and Commentary on Law of Trusts” by Hayton 7th Ed. Stevens & Sons at Page 510 were called in aid. The Appellants maintained that the 1st Respondent used the rent proceeds collected from the property to develop the property and that the Development Lease Agreement is, in consequence, illegal, null and void. It was conclusively submitted that the Lower Court was wrong in holding that the Deed of Partition and Development Lease Agreement were legal and valid in law and not liable to be set aside.  The quiddity of the Appellants submission on issue number three is that the Lower Court was wrong in holding that the 1st Respondent had become the sole owner of the property by virtue of her having purchased the same. It was argued that in the absence of evidence that the leasehold jointly owned by the parties had expired, the 1st Respondent’s purchase of the property could not extinguish the subsisting lease. The Appellants submit that the 1st Respondent’s Purchase Agreement, Exhibit D6, was executed on 10th February, 1977 before the death of their father and that having counterclaimed that she used her money to purchase the property, she failed to lead evidence to show the source of the money she used to purchase the property. The Appellants contended that it was their joint money, the proceeds of rent from the property that the 1st Respondent used to pay for the property. It was opined that the purchase receipts relied on by the 1st Respondent, Exhibits D3A and B were issued in the name of their deceased father and not the 1st Respondent, and that it does not show that it relates to No. 3, Otigbah Street, Ikeja, Lagos.  It is the further contention of the Appellants that the 1st Respondent is described in the Purchase Agreement, Exhibit D6, as the Administratrix of the Estate of their late father and that being a trustee she cannot be allowed to buy the trust property vide EX P JAMES 1803 8 VES 337 at 344, EX P LACEY 1802 6 VES 625 at 626, SILKSTONE & HAIGH MOOR COAL CO. vs. EDEY 1990 1 Ch. 1, FARRAR vs. FARRAR LTD 1888 40 Ch. D 395 and JOLUGBO vs. AINA supra. It was conclusively submitted that the lower Court failed to properly evaluate the evidence as a result of which it made preserve findings and entered judgment on the 1st Respondent’s counterclaim thereby occasioning a miscarriage of justice.  RESOLUTION Shorn of the rind, the core of the contest in this appeal is not convoluted. It has not been confuted that the property in question in this matter belonged to the late Paul Dawson Otigbah and that he executed Exhibit C1, assigning the property to his children, the parties to this appeal. The Lower Court found and held at page 518 of the Records that even though Exhibit C1 only refers to the 1st Respondent by name, the expression therein that it includes her sisters and other brothers being children of the late Paul Dawson Otigbah, shows that the property was assigned to his children jointly. There is no appeal against this finding. Even though the 1st Respondent filed a Notice of Contention in this regard, she failed to prosecute the same, having failed to file a Respondent’s Brief and she also did not appear at the hearing. In any event, the thrust of the 1st Respondent’s Notice of Contention see pages 538-539 of the Records is to overturn the finding of the Lower Court that the Appellants and the Respondents are joint owners of the property. This is not the purpose of a Respondent’s Notice of Contention for the judgment to be affirmed on grounds other than those relied on by the Court. The Respondents Notice of Contention is resorted to where the position of the Respondent is that the judgment was based on wrong grounds or premise; and that there is evidence on record which can sustain the judgment on grounds other than those relied upon by the Trial Court. The Respondents Notice of Contention postulates the correctness of the judgment. See AMERICAN CYANAMID COMPANY vs. VITALITY PHARMACEUTICALS LTD 1991 2 NWLR PT 171 15 or 1991 LPELR 461 1 at 23-24, SUNMONU vs. ASHOROTA 1975 1 NMLR 16 and LAGOS CITY COUNCIL vs. AJAYI 1970 1 ALL NLR 291.  It goes without saying that a Respondents’ Notice that postulates the correctness of the decision appealed against cannot complain about the decision of the Court. Where the 1st Respondent seeks to have the finding and decision of the Lower Court that all the children of late Paul Dawson Otigbah are joint owners of the property reversed, the appropriate procedure is for her to file a cross appeal. It is not to be achieved by a Respondents Notice of Contention to affirm: AFRICAN CONTINENTAL SEAWAYS LTD vs. NIGERIAN DREDGING ROADS AND GENERAL WORKS LTD 1977 5 SC 235, ELIOCHIN NIG. LTD vs. MBADIWE 1986 1 NWLR PT. 14 47, ORO vs. FALADE 1995 5 NWLR PT. 398 385 and COUNTY & CITY BRICKS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LTD vs. MKC NIGERIA LTD 2019 LPELR 46889 1 at 8-11.  So by the unchallenged finding and decision of the Lower Court, the parties are joint owners of No. 3, Otigbah Street, Ikeja, Lagos. Having so found and held, the Lower Court correctly identified the question that arises as being the status of the subsequent acts and documents executed by the 1st Respondent and the land owning family and subsequently between the 1st and 2nd Respondents see page 518 of the Records. Now, for clarity, the document executed between the 1st Respondent and the land owning family is the Purchase Agreement, Exhibit D6; while the documents executed between the Respondents are the Deed of Partition, Exhibit C2 and the Development Lease, Exhibit C3. It is on the strength of these said documents that the 1st Respondent counterclaimed, inter alia, for a declaration that she had bought the property in dispute and was now the owner of the said property and can partition, develop, lease and do with it as she pleases. It is therefore lucent that 1st Respondent bases the propriety of the Deed of Partition, Exhibit C2 and the Development Lease, Exhibit C3, on her having purchased and become the sole owner of the property. In answering the question it raised as to the status of the documents executed between the 1st Respondent and the land owning family, the Lower Court stated and held thus at pages 520-521 of the Records: “The question this Court asks itself is what would have become of the property had the 1st Defendant not purchased it. The answer is simple. The property would have reverted at the expiration of the leasehold to the landowners and there would have been nothing to fight over today. This Court has perused the said Exhibit C1 very carefully. It is unable to find any term of years of the said leasehold in the document. What was the unexpired residue? The actual Deed of Lease referred to in Exhibit C1 was never tendered by any of the Parties herein. It was however made in 1976. The said Deed of Assignment - Exhibit C1 - is dated 2nd day of June, 1977. No Letters of Administration were tendered. It is therefore irrelevant that the 1st Defendant is referred to in Exhibit D6 as Admistrator [sic]. The outright purchase by the 1st Defendant vide Exhibits D3A & B & D6 was in 1996, 20 years after Exhibit C1. Unfortunately, this Court without concrete evidence cannot speculate on whether the Lease was about to run out or not at the time the 1st Defendant purchased same”.  From Exhibit D6, there is no such indication either but there are clauses that indicate of a reversion by inheritance. Clauses 4, 5 & 6 of Exhibit D6 are reproduced hereunder for ease of reference: Clauses 4, 5 & 6 of Exhibit D6: 4. By virtue of the said lease agreement, the purchaser has been in undisturbed possession of the said parcel of land since 1976. 5. Upon the death of the original owner of the plot of land known and described as No. 3 Otigbah Street, Ikeja, the vendor in this Deed who is the child of late Madam Ayinke Banjoke Aro inherited the parcel of land in accordance with Yoruba Native Law and Custom. 6. The vendor for himself and on behalf of all the members of the family of late Madam Ayinke Banjoke Aro have agreed to sell to the Purchaser the plot of land described in this Deed. Thus, as at the time the 1st Defendant bought the leasehold which her father had assigned to all his children had been overtaken by the superior purchase which she had done with her own funds & subsequently then developed as per the uncontroverted evidence before the Court.  To this Court’s mind, her status at that point changed from joint beneficiary and assignee to Owner. This Court so finds and holds. Therefore the issue of her rendering account to the Claimants does not arise. Still from the evidence before the Court, in her magnanimity and because her father as she stated said she should show her siblings love, she still invited them to partake of a property which had has [sic] she not bought, would have reverted to the land owners. From the evidence before this Court, this is the genesis and what led to the partitioning of the property.  With due deference to the learned counsel for the Appellants, the critical question is not on the duties of a trustee which was dwelt upon in the Appellants’ Brief. The clear reasoning of the Lower Court is that the 1st Respondent had become sole owner and therefore the issue of her rendering an account would not arise and that it was in obedience to their father’s wishes that she magnanimously partitioned her property with her siblings. It is my considered view that the critical issue is whether the Lower Court correctly held that the 1st Respondent had become the owner of the property. This is the crux of Appellants’ issue number three. It is premised on the manner this issue is resolved that would determine the fate of the Deed of Partition, Exhibit C2, the Development Lease, Exhibit C3 and indeed the Appellants demand for an account since based on the reasoning of the Lower Court, the 1st Respondent having become the owner was within her rights in her actions consequent upon which it dismissed the Appellants’ case.  As found and held by the Lower Court, there was no evidence before it as to whether the lease granted to the late Paul Dawson Otigbah had expired as at the time the 1st Respondent purchased the property. The Deed of Assignment assigning the property to the parties herein, Exhibit C1, is dated 2nd June 1977. It recites that Paul Dawson Otigbah is entitled to the property by virtue of the Deed of Lease dated 25th August, 1976. The Purchase Agreement, Exhibit D6, by virtue of which the 1st Respondent claims ownership of the property is dated 10th February, 1977, about four months before Exhibit C1. So based on the documentary evidence before the Lower Court, as at 10th February 1977 when the Purchase Agreement, Exhibit D6, was entered into, the land owning family had already divested their interest and vested the same in Paul Dawson Otigbah by virtue of the Deed of Lease dated 25th August,1976. So as at 10th February 1977, the date on Exhibit D6, they did not have any title to pass to the 1st Respondent. Taking it a notch farther, the Lower Court also relied on the purchase receipts, Exhibits D3A, & B, to show the outright purchase of the property by the 1st Respondent. Now, the purchase receipts, Exhibits D3A & B, are dated 6th March, 1996 and 2nd October, 1996 respectively. This was during the subsistence of Exhibit C1. The late Paul Dawson Otigbah, having assigned his interest to his children by Exhibit C1, which as held by the Lower Court made them joint owners of the property, the land owning family did not have the property to sell to the 1st Respondent in 1996.  The well established legal maxim is expressed in the Latinis,m nemo dat quod non habet; meaning that no one may give that which does not belong to him. At all times material to Exhibits D3A & B and Exhibit D6, the land owning family had divested itself of the property and it had nothing left to convey to any person. See OLOHUNDE vs. ADEYOJU 2000 LPELR 2586 1 at 25, OJENGBEDE vs. ESAN 2001 LPELR 2372 1 at 28, IBRAHIM vs. OSUNDE 2009 LPELR 1411 1 at 30, ADELAJA vs. FANOIKI 1990 LPELR 110 1 at 25, OKELOLA vs. ADELEKE 2004 LPELR 2438 1 at 17 and GBADAMOSI vs. AKINLOYE 2013 LPELR 20937 1 at 29-30. Accordingly, the 1st Respondent did not acquire any interest to the property by any of Exhibits D3A & B and Exhibit D6.  Exhibits C1, D3A & B and D6 were in evidence at nisi prius. The lower Court as the trial Court has the duty of evaluation of evidence and ascription of probative value thereto. There is a duty on the trial Court to receive all available relevant evidence on an issue. This is perception of evidence. After that there is another duty to weigh that evidence in the context of the surrounding circumstances of the case. This is evaluation of evidence. A finding of fact will entail both perception and evaluation. See OLUFOSOYE vs. OLORUNFEMI 1989 1 SC PT I 29 or 1989 LPELR 2615 1 at 9, GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER LTD vs. AJEH 2011 10 NWLR PT. 1255 574 at 592 and WACHUKWU vs. OWUNWANNE 2011 LPELR 3466 1 at 50-51.  There is little or no difficulty with perception of evidence, id est, receive all available relevant evidence. It is in perception of evidence that the Lower Court admitted Exhibits C1, D3A & B and D6 in evidence. Evaluation of evidence on the other hand is basically the assessment of the facts by the trial Court to ascertain which of the parties to a case before it has more preponderant evidence to sustain his claim. See ONWUKA vs. EDIALA 1989 1 NWLR PT. 96 182 at 208-209, OYADIJI vs. OLANIYI 2005 5 NWLR PT. 919 561 and AMEYO vs. OYEWOLE 2008 LPELR 3768 1 at 9. The evaluation involves a reasoned belief of the evidence of one of the contending parties and disbelief of the other or a reasoned preference of one version to the other. A Court of trial has the duty to consider the evidence adduced in respect of any facts on which issues were joined, decide which evidence to prefer on the basis of how the evidence preponderates and then make logical and consequential findings of facts. See ADEYEYE vs. AJIBOYE 1987 1 NWLR PT 61 432 at 451 and STEPHEN vs. THE STATE 1986 5 NWLR PT 46 978 at 1005.  The settled legal position is that where a trial Court unquestionably evaluates and justifiably appraises the facts, it is not the business of an Appellate Court to substitute its own views for the views of the Trial Court, however, an Appellate Court can intervene where there is insufficient evidence to sustain the judgment; or where the Trial Court fails to make proper use of the opportunity of seeing, hearing, and observing the witnesses; or where the findings of facts by the Trial Court cannot be regarded as resulting from the evidence or where the Trial Court has drawn wrong conclusion from accepted evidence or has taken an erroneous view of the evidence adduced before it or its findings are perverse in the sense that they do not flow from accepted evidence or not supported by the evidence before the Court. See FHA vs. OLAYEMI 2017 LPELR 43376 1 at 69-71, EDJEKPO vs. OSIA 2007 8 NWLR PT. 1037 635 or 2007 LPELR 1014 1 at 46-47, ARE vs. IPAYE 1990 LPELR 541 1 at 22, WOLUCHEM vs. GUDI 1981 5 SC 291 at 320 and FASIKUN II vs. OLURONKE II 1999 2 NWLR PT.  589 1 or 1999 LPELR 1248 1 at 47-48.  The ascription of probative value by the Lower Court to Exhibits D3A & B and D6 as showing that the 1st Respondent had become the sole owner of the property did not take into cognisance the application of the principle of nemo dat quod non habet, since at the material time the transaction in the said Exhibits were undertaken, it was not shown on the evidence that the leasehold title of the late Paul Dawson Otigbah which he assigned to his children had expired. This being so, in the light of the said subsisting interest, the land owning family had no interest in the property to pass to the 1st Respondent. The Lower Court consequently drew wrong conclusions from the evidence and made findings of facts that do not result from the evidence. Ineluctably, having taken an erroneous view of the evidence, the findings which the Lower Court arrived at that the 1st Respondent had become the sole owner of the property are perverse as they are not supported by the evidence on record. In the circumstance, the Lower Court having failed to properly evaluate the evidence, and the question of evaluation of evidence not involving the credibility of witnesses, this Court is in as good a position as the Court of trial to intervene, evaluate the evidence, set aside the perverse findings in order to obviate miscarriage of justice and then make the consequential and proper findings of facts. See NARUMAL & SONS NIG LTD vs. NIGER BENUE TRANSPORT COMPANY LTD 1989 2 NWLR PT 106 730 at 742, ABISI vs. EKWEALOR 1993 LPELR 44 1 at 51-55, ATOLAGBE vs. SHORUN 1985 1 NWLR PT 2 360 and SAPO vs. SUNMONU 2010 LPELR 3015 1 at 54-55. For the reasons already advanced and based on the applicability of the legal principle of nemo dat quod non habet, Exhibits D3A & B and D6 do not have the vires to form the basis on which the 1st Respondent can be said to be the sole owner of the property. The position therefore remained as held by the Lower Court, that by virtue of Exhibit C1, the parties were joint owners of the property.  It is on the basis of the erroneous finding that the 1st Respondent had become the sole owner of the property that the Lower Court held that the Appellants’ claim for account to be rendered does not arise and that it was magnanimous of the 1st Respondent to have partitioned and shared her property with the Appellants and the 2nd Respondent. This brings us to the Deed of Partition, Exhibit C2. By the said Exhibit C2, the joint property of the parties was shared in two equal halves with the 1st Respondent taking one half while the Appellants and the 2nd Respondent jointly had the other half. Furthermore, Exhibit C2 was only executed by the Respondents and there is no evidence that the Appellants, as joint owners of the property, consented to the property being partitioned. The law is settled that in order for there to be a valid partition of a property which is jointly owned, all the co-owners have to consent to the property being partitioned and the partitioning has to be in equal shares or where that cannot be attained, provision would be made for payment of money to secure equality of partition: BARUWA vs. OSOBA 1996 LPELR 13680 1 at 14-16 and 24-26, ADELEKE vs. ASERIFA 1986 3 NWLR PT. 30 575, ADEGOKE vs. OLOTIN 2019 LPELR 48766 1 at 27 -28 and ODEKILEKUN vs. HASSAN 1997 LPELR 2206 1 at 24-25. From the evidence on record, the Deed of Partition, Exhibit C2, is therefore not valid since the Appellants did not consent to the partitioning and the partitioning was also not done on equal basis.  With regard to the Development Lease Agreement, Exhibit C3, it provides for a ten year duration commencing on the 1st day of November, 2008 and terminating on the 31st day of October, 2018. So the said Development Lease Agreement is no longer extant, having expired by effluxion of time. The Development Lease stipulates that at the expiration of the ten year period, the 1st Respondent shall give up possession and surrender the shops. The effect of having held that the Deed of Partition, Exhibit C2, is invalid and that the 1st Respondent is not the sole owner of the property, is that the property as developed reverts to the parties under the joint ownership established by Exhibit C1. The Lower court found and held that on the evidence the 2nd Respondent voluntarily signed Exhibit C3 and that his signature was witnessed by the 6th Appellant. Furthermore, that they collected some money as their share based on the stipulations of Exhibit C3. The contention of the Appellants that the property was developed with the proceeds of the rent from the property is inutile since I have already stated that the Development Lease having effluxed, the property reverts to the joint ownership established by Exhibit C1. From the evidence, the parties have benefitted from Exhibit C3 in line with its stipulations; the law and indeed equity will not allow the Appellants to repudiate or disown the said Exhibit C3 on any ground, more so, when it has now run its course as provided therein: OHIEWERI vs OKOSUN2003 11 NWLR PT. 832 463, BATALHA vs. WEST CONST. CO. LTD 2001 18 NWLR PT. 744 85, ACHU vs. CIVIL SERv. COMM., CROSS RIVER STATE 2009 3 NWLR PT. 1129 475 and NATIONAL UNION OF ROAD TRANSPORT WORKERS vs. FIRST CONTINENTAL INSURANCE CO. LTD 2019 LPELR 48005 1 at 39-41.  Turning to the claim for accounts to be rendered, the lower Court in refusing the claim reasoned and held as follows at page 521 of the Records: “Thus, as at the time the 1st Defendant bought the leasehold which her father had assigned to all his children had been overtaken by the superior purchase which she had done with her own funds & subsequently then developed as per the uncontroverted evidence before the Court. To this Court’s mind, her status at that point changed from joint beneficiary and assignee to Owner. This Court so finds and holds. Therefore the issue of her rendering account to the Claimants does not arise.”  The evidence on record is that the 1st Respondent has been collecting the rent from the property See pages 445 and 456-458 of the Records. Having held in this judgment that the Lower Court wrongly held that the 1st Respondent is the sole owner of the property, the foundational basis on which the Lower Court held that the issue of rendering account does not arise has been defenestrated. In the circumstances, since the property is the joint property of the parties and the evidence is that the 1st Respondent has been collecting the rent from the tenants, she is obligated to render an account to her co-owners. I am not oblivious of the evidence and finding of the Lower Court that the 1st Respondent had been providing for the upkeep and education of the Appellants; this however does not absolve the 1st Respondent from rendering accounts. See MESRS MISR NIG LTD vs. IBRAHIM  1974 5 SC 55 at 61, EME vs. WAMUOH 1991 7 NWLR PT 203 375 at 389, GODWIN vs. THE CHRIST APOSTOLIC CHURCH 1998 LPELR 1327 1 at 27-28 and NJOKU vs. BALOGUN 2018 LPELR 46983 1 at 41- 44.  The conflating of the foregoing is that this appeal is meritorious. The decision of the Lower Court dismissing the Appellants’ claim and entering judgment for the 1st Respondent on her counterclaim is hereby set aside. In its stead, the 1st Respondent’s counterclaim is hereby dismissed in its entirety and judgment is entered for the Appellants in the following terms: 1. It is hereby declared that the Deed of Partition between Mrs. Agatha Adetutu Uwanaka Nee Otigbah and George Ifeanyi Otigbah dated 23rd June, 2008 is illegal, unlawful, null, void and of no legal effect. 2. It is hereby declared that by virtue of the Deed of Assignment dated 2nd June, 1977 between Paul Dawson Otigbah and Agatha Adetutu Otigbah for herself and other children of the Assignor registered as No. 55 at page 55 in Volume 1627 of the Lagos State of Nigeria Land Registry, Ikeja, Lagos, the Appellants and the Respondents are joint owners on equal basis of No. 3, Otigbah Street, Ikeja, Lagos. 3. The Respondents are hereby restrained from giving effect to the Deed of Partition between Agatha Adetutu Uwanaka Nee Otigbah and George Ifeanyi Otigbah dated 23rd June, 2008. 4. The said Deed of Partition dated 23rd June, 2008 is hereby set aside. 5. The 1st Respondent is hereby ordered to give an account of all the proceeds of rent collected by her from inception until 29th February, 2020 and to pay over to the Appellants all the monies due to them as joint owners of the property. 6. The Appellants are entitled to the costs of this appeal which I assess and fix at N500, 000.00 against the 1st Respondent.   MOHAMMED LAWAL GARBA, J.C.A.:  I agree   JAMILU YAMMAMA TUKUR, J.C.A.:  I had the advantage of reading in draft the lead judgment just delivered by my learned brother UGOCHUKWU ANTHONY OGAKWU, JCA and I adopt the judgment as mine with nothing further to add.

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The parties in this appeal are scions from the loins of the late Paul Dawson Otigbah. He sired them from two different women. The Appellants and the 2nd Respondent are children of the same mother while the 1st Respondent has a different mother. The common denominator between the parties is their late father. The root of the contest in this appeal is the property left behind by their father. The property is situated at No 3 Otigbah Street, Ikeja, Lagos. In his lifetime, their father by a Deed of Assignment dated 2nd June, 1977 assigned the said property to his children, the parties herein, out of love, bond and affection. The said Deed of Assignment was admitted at the trial as Exhibit C1. Subsequently, a Deed of Partition was executed between the 1st Respondent and the 2nd Respondent partitioning the property. The Deed of Partition is Exhibit C2. There is also a Development Lease by which the 1st Respondent was to develop and take control of the property. The Development Lease is Exhibit C3. The Deed of Partition and the Development Lease are both dated 23rd June 2008. Furthermore, there is a Purchase Agreement, it is between the original owners of the land and the 1st Respondent. It is dated 10th February, 1977. By the said Purchase Agreement, the property was sold to the 1st Respondent as the outright sole owner of the property. It is Exhibit D6 in this matter.  Now, the Appellants contending that the Deed of Partition and Development Lease Agreement are illegal and that the 1st Respondent had failed to give an account of rents collected from the tenants at the property instituted proceedings before the High Court of Lagos State in SUIT NO. ID/1174/2011: MAUREEN OTIGBAH & ORS vs. AGATHA ADETUTU UWANAKA (nee OTIGBAH) & ANOR. wherein they claimed the following reliefs: “1. A DECLARATION that the purported Deed of Partition between Mrs. Agatha Adetutu Uwanaka (Nee Otigbah) and George Ifeanyi Otigbah dated 23rd June, 2008 is illegal, unlawful, null, void and of no legal effect. 2. A DECLARATION that the purported Development Agreement/Lease between George Ifeanyi Otigbah and Mrs. Agatha Adetutu Uwanaka (Nee Otigbah) purportedly signed on 3rd April, 2009 is illegal, unlawful, null, void and of no legal effect. 3. A DECLARATION that by virtue of the Deed of Assignment dated 2nd June, 1977 between Paul Dawson Otigbah and Agatha Adetutu Otigbah for herself and other children of the Assignor registered as No. 55 Page 55 in Volume 1627 of the Lagos State of Nigeria Land Registry, Ikeja, Lagos, the Claimants and the Defendants are joint owners on equal basis of 3, Otigbah Street, Ikeja., Lagos. 4. AN ORDER permanently restraining the Defendants from giving effect to the purported deed of partition between Agatha Adetutu Nwanaka (Nee Otigbah) and George Ifeanyi Otigbah dated 23rd June, 2008. 5. AN ORDER setting aside the said Deed of Partition and the Development Agreement/Lease entered into between the 1st Defendant and the 2nd Defendant. 6. AN ORDER directing the 1st Defendant to give account of all proceeds of rent collected by her from inception till the final determination of the suit. 7. AN ORDER compelling the 1st Defendant to pay over to the Claimants all funds due to them as joint owners of the property in dispute.”  The 1st Respondent set up a counter-claim and she claimed the following reliefs: “1. A DECLARATION that what the late Pa Dawson transferred to his children was his unexpired residue in the leasehold of and the 1st defendant having converted it to a freehold by buying the said property in dispute, she is now the owner of the said property and can partition, develop, lease and do with it as she pleases. 2. A DECLARATION that the said Deed of Partition and Development Agreement/Lease is legal and valid and should stand as per terms in it. 3. The sum of One Million Naira (N1,000,000) being the cost and Professional fees for this Litigation be charged against the Estate.”  The matter was subjected to a full dressed hearing at which testimonial and documentary evidence was adduced by the parties. In its judgment delivered on 30th June, 2015, the Lower Court dismissed the Appellants’ case and entered judgment for the 1st Respondent in terms of her counterclaim.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  EJEMBI EKO, J.S.C. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  The Appellant's statutory Right of Occupancy R of O, the grant of which was evidenced by the Certificate of Occupancy C of O No. DG 001042007 registered in the Lands Registry office, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, was revoked and the revocation was published in the Ekiti State Government 1st Respondent's official Gazette No. 1, Vol. 20 of 20th October, 2016. The Appellant, as the Plaintiff at State High Court, sitting at Ado Ekiti, challenged the revocation contending, inter alia, that the revocation was illegal, unconstitutional and a nullity and that it be declared that he remained vested with the R of O over the disputed land - the same having neither been extinguished nor in anyway affected in law by the purported revocation. He also sought a declaration that the subsequent re-allocation of the disputed plot of land to the 4th Respondent, who allegedly actively instigated the revocation of the Appellant's R of O, was illegal, unlawful and a nullity. The Appellant further sought a perpetual injunctive order to restrain the 1st - 3rd DefendantsRespondents from issuing any C of O to the 4th Respondent andor restraining the 4th DefendantRespondent from howsoever interfering with his structures built on the land. In the ALTERNATIVE claims, the Appellant sought a declaration that he was in no way in default or breach of any term, condition or obligation in the C of O for the grant of the R of O.  The Appellant's Statement of Claim at the trial Court was specially endorsed on the writ of summons taken out on 16th January, 2017. The revocation the Appellant complained of was conveyed in the official Gazette published on 20th October, 2016.  The Respondents, as Defendants, had by way of demurrer, contrary to Order 22 Rules 1 & 2 of the Ekiti State High Court Civil Procedure Rules, filed Notices of Preliminary Objection on 1st February, 2017 supported by affidavits contending that the trial High Court lacked \"jurisdiction to entertain this action and prays that the suit be struck out in limine\". The 1st - 3rd Respondents filed a joint Notice of preliminary objection, independent of the 4th Respondent. The 1st - 3rd Respondents' Notice of Preliminary Objection, more exhaustive than that of the 4th Respondent's Notice, was predicated on the grounds that the suit - i. was \"statute barred having been brought outside of the three months period stipulated by Section 2 of the Public Officers Protection Act as the 1st to 3rd DefendantsAppellants issued the Claimant with notice of revocation via letter dated 16th December, 2014 on the ground that the Claimant breached Paragraph 4 of the Certificate of Occupancy. ii. disclosed no reasonable cause of action.  In the supporting affidavit, particularly paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 thereof, the 1st - 3rd Respondents founded justification for their revoking the Appellant's R of O on the grounds that the Appellant had serially breached and violated the terms and conditions in the C of O under which the R of O was granted; that the Appellant, instead of paying ground rents, \"appealed for waiver which was not granted\" and was thereby in breach of paragraph 12ii of the C of O - Exhibit C. They further alleged that the Appellant was in breach of paragraph 4 of the C of O that enjoined the Appellant to erect and complete buildings in accordance with the approved building plans within two years. They admitted that the Appellant had merely built a perimeter fence round the disputed land. The Appellant vehemently opposed the Notices of Preliminary Objections.  In a lengthy Ruling of 53 pages on the two Notices of Preliminary Objection, the learned trial Judge C. L Akintayo, J delivered on 5th June, 2017, sustained the preliminary Objection on the grounds that the suit of the Appellant, by virtue of Section 2a of Public Officers Protection Act POPA, was statute barred having not been filed within 3 months after the revocation and further that the Appellant had not disclosed any reasonable cause of action in his statement of claim. His appeal against the decision was unsuccessful - hence this further appeal.   The Appellant has formulated 7 issues for the determination of the appeal. My Lords, in my firm view, two major issues stand out for the determination of this appeal, that is - whether by virtue of Section 2a of the Public Officers Protection Act the suit of the Appellant at the trial Court was statute barred; and whether the Appellant disclosed, in the Statement of Claim, any reasonable cause of action?  The Appellant, under his issue 3, contends that the suit, by operation of POPA, was not statute barred. The Respondents postulate the contrary. The 1st - 3rd Respondents, in paragraph 4.75 of their Brief, insist \"that the action of the Appellant is caught by Section 2a of the Public Officers Protection Act\" having been instituted outside the 3 months reckoned from 22nd December, 2014 when the cause of Action accrued. The 4th Respondent maintains his position, concurrently affirmed by the two Courts below, that \"the Appellant's action was statute barred by the operation of the Public Officers Protection Act\".  The Respondents appear to me to have taken shelter under Section 2 a of the Public Officers Protection Act, Cap P41, 2004 LFN updated up to the 31st day of December, 2010. This Act enacted pursuant to Item 53 of the Exclusive Legislative List and Section 42 & 3 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, as amended, applies only to protect public officers in the \"public service of the Federation\". It has no general application such as to apply or offer protection to public officers in the service of Ekiti State or any other State in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The public Service of Ekiti State is a matter within the residual list, that is matter neither in the Exclusive Legislative List set out in Part l of the Second Schedule to the Constitution nor in the Concurrent Legislative List set out in the First Column of the Second Schedule to the Constitution. The public service of Ekiti State, being a residual matter, only the Ekiti State House of Assembly, by dint of Section 46 & 7 of the Constitution,1999, as amended, to the exclusion of the National Assembly or any other State House of Assembly, can constitutionally legislate on it.  This basic Constitutional Law eluded the Respondents and the two Courts below. The resort to the Federal statute, the Public officers Protection Act, to scrounge a statutory defence for officers in Ekiti State public service is no doubt ultra vires.  This apart, granted Public Officers Protection Act were invokable by officers in the public service of Ekiti State, the two Courts below misapplied the scope of the Act to the peculiar facts of this case.  The Appellant had consistently submitted to the two Courts below that the provision of Section 2a of the Public Officers Protection Act is not applicable to the instant case, in that the action was founded on recovery of land andor breach of contract. This Court had, in A. G. RIVERS STATE v. A. G. BAYELSA STATE 2013 3 NWLR pt. 1340 123 at 150; MULIMA v. USMAN 2014 16 NWLR pt. 1432 160 at 212, held that \"the protection afforded public officers under the public Officers protection Act does not apply in cases of recovery of land\".  The second limb of the Appellant's submission on the scope of Section 2a of the Public Officers Protection Act is that the provision does not apply to cases founded on contract, or breach of contract. The Appellant is correct. Numerous judicial dicta of this Court support this submission. OSUN STATE GOVERNMENT v. DALAMI NIG LTD 2007 9 NWLR pt. 1038 66 is a case founded on breach of lease agreement. The respondent sued the Osun State Government seeking a declaration that the latter's purported termination of the Management Lease Agreement was wrongful. The respondent sought a further order nullifying or setting aside the purported termination, and an order for specific performance. Osun State Government pleaded limitation afforded by the Public Officers Protection Act. This Court unanimously rejected the plea and held that Section 2 of the Public Officers Protection Act does not apply in cases for recovery of land or breach of contract. It cited, with approval, previous decisions on the point in SALAKO v. L.E.D.B 1953 20 NLR 159; NPA v. CONSTRUZIONI GENRALI F.C.S 1974 9 NSCC 622; 1969 1 ALL NLR pt. 2 463; BANKOLE v. NBL 1969 NCLR 385 at 390.  It is very clear from the ipixit dexit of the Respondents, at pages 150 - 160 and 191 - 192 of the Record, in their respective preliminary objections, that they justified the revocation of the Appellant's R. of O on the fact that the Appellant was in breach of the contract terms, conditions and obligations contained in the C of O. They accordingly invoked the provision of Section 2aof the Public Officers Protection Act, being a special defence, as having extinguished the Appellant's right to enforce the cause of action founded on the said breach of contract. It is apparent also from paragraphs 2.3; 4.43; 4.58; 4.91; 4.100 - 106, and 4.109 of the 1st - 3rd Respondents Brief that they had, contrary to established judicial precedents, invoked Section 2a Public Officers Protection Act  as a statutory bar to Appellant's cause of action premised on breach of the contractual terms, condition or obligations in the Certificate of Occupancy.  In my firm view, my Lords, the two Courts below were in error to have acted on Section 2a Public Officers Protection Act to strike out the suit of the Appellant for being statute barred. The scope of the Act does not extend to actions founded on recovery of land or breach of contract. The two Courts below had definitely misconceived the scope and spirit of the Act. This issue is resolved in favour of the Appellant against the Respondents.  The Second reason given by the trial Court for striking out the Appellant's suit was that the statement of claim did not disclose any reasonable cause of action. The lower Court subsequently affirmed this obviously perverse finding of fact. The contention that the Appellant, as the claimant, did not in his statement of claim disclose any reasonable cause of action was largely instrumented by the erroneous finding that the suit was statute barred. It is of course true, and the law is, that where an action is statute barred the effect is that the cause of action is or becomes extinct by operation and it can no longer be maintained in the law Court: SOSAN v. ADEMUYIWA 1986 3 NWLR pt.27 241. Consequently, a cause of action extinguished or statute barred cannot be a reasonable cause of action.  The appellant had in the statement of claim alleged that the revocation of his R of O, actively instigated maliciously by the 4th DefendantRespondent, was wrongful, baseless and in bad faith. The Respondents admit that the right of occupancy over the disputed parcel of land vested originally in the Appellant and that it was revoked. They joined issues with the Appellant in their supporting affidavit at pages 159 - 160 of the Record where they averred that the disputed plot was allocated to the Appellant upon certain conditions including his perimeter fencing and developing the land in accordance with the approved building plans within 2 years of the issuance of the C of O; that the Appellant only fenced the plot and had not built or developed it in terms of the purpose of the grant; that the Appellant, instead of paying his ground rents as and when due, was asking for waiver. In the statement of claim, the Appellant had alleged that the refusal of the 1st - 3rd Respondents to properly compute the ground rents was a mere fait accompli for the malicious revocation of the R of O; that the ulterior purpose of the revocation was to satisfy the avarice of his neighbour, the 4th Respondent, who persistently actuatedinstigated the revocation from which he benefited by the subsequent re-allocation of the same plot. The Appellant further averred, in the Statement of Claim, that the 4th Respondent, who had initially encroached on the land and reduced its size, was told to buy the land for N750,000,000.00 and that instead of making formal offer to buy or pay for the land chose rather, mala fide, to instigate the 1st - 3rd Respondents to revoke the R of O vested in the Appellant by petition writing. That the Governor of Ekiti State, the 1st Respondent, pandered to the instigation and petitions of the 4th Respondent by unilaterally, albeit maliciously and arbitrarily, declaring the area of the disputed land \"Education Free Zone\", only thereafter to re-allocate the disputed plot to the 4th Respondent.  In the face of the myriad allegations or complaints of the Appellant, as can be seen from the Statement of Claim particularly paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32 thereof the learned trial Judge found, and the lower Court affirmed, that the Statement of Claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action. I think and I hold the firm view, that the two Courts below were wrong in holding that the Appellant did not disclose any reasonable cause of action.  A cause of action simply means the fact not evidence that will be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, to support his right to judgment: THE SUPREME COURT PRACTICE THE WHITE BOOK - English 1991, vol. 1, pages 172 - 173 paragraph 15123: states that \"A cause of action\" was held to mean \"the subject-matter of grievance founding the action\": O'KEEFE v. WALSH 1903 2, Ir. R.681 at 718; ANNS v. MERTON LONDON BOROUGH COUNCIL 1978 2 ALL E.R. 492. In other words, it is the reason for the grievance and the complaint to the Court for redress. It includes every material fact the plaintiff must, or shall, prove to enable him succeed against the defendant: AFOLAYAN v. OGUNRINDE & ORS {1990 2 SCNJ 62 at 70.   In other words, as Obaseki, JSC had put it, in THOMAS v. OLUFOSOYE 1986 1 NWLR {pt. 18 669, the cause of action is the factual situation, the existence of which entitles one to obtain from the Court a remedy against another person. See also Lord Esher, M. R in READ v. BROWN 1998 2 QBD 128 at 131 & 151- cited with approval by this Court in SPDC OF NIG LTD v. XM 2005 7 SC pt. 2 189; 2006 16 NWLR pt. 1004 27.  For so long as the Statement of Claim discloses the cause the plaintiff has to complain to the Court against the defendant for violation, infraction or imposition of undue burden on his legal rights or obligations, or raises some question fit to be decided by the Court or the Judge: a reasonable cause is disclosed thereby: YUSUF & ORS v. AKINDIPE & ORS 2000 8 NWLR pt. 669 376 SC. In my view, a reasonable cause of action is disclosed once the Statement of Claim sets out the plaintiff's legal right qua the defendant's obligations towards him, and goes further to set out the facts constituting the infraction of the plaintiffs' legal rights or failure of the defendant to fulfill his obligations towards the plaintiff: RINCO  CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. VEEPEE IND. LTD & ANOR 2005 9 NWLR pt. 929. Once the Statement of Claim discloses a reasonable chance that the plaintiff will succeed, if not traversed, on his allegations as pleaded; a reasonable cause of action will be said to have been disclosed. That is the substance of the English decision in DRUMMOND-JACOKSON v. BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION 1970 1 WLR 688; 1970 1 ALL E. R. 1094 CA cited with approval in THOMAS & ORS v. OLUFOSOYE supra. It is not material at this stage whether the case of the plaintiff is strong or weak. The only thing important at this stage is whether the Court can decipher from the Statement of Claim if there is either a prima facie triable case or issue or there is a reasonable chance of success if no defence were offered.  It is clear from the Notices of Preliminary Objection that the Respondents made efforts, at this interlocutory stage, to join issues with the Appellant on the salient allegations against them. They also raised special defences in law, without filing defence by way of demurer, to the claims of the Appellant. It does not lie in their mouths to say that the Statement of Claim, in the circumstances, does not disclose any reasonable cause of action against them. The concurrent finding of fact that the Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable cause of action is perverse, and it is hereby set aside. I hereby resolve this issue against the Respondents.  The Preliminary Objections argued at the trial Court are hereby overruled. The concurrent decisions of the two Courts below sustaining the preliminary objections are hereby set aside.  The appeal succeeds. The decision of the trial Court, by which the suit of the Appellant was struck out is hereby set aside. The suit is hereby restored on the cause List of the trial Court to be heard and determined by a Judge of the said Court other than C.I. Akintayo, J. This order shall forthwith be served on the Chief Judge of Ekiti State.  The Appellant is entitled to costs having from the trial Court through the lower Court to this Court thrown away costs by the needless and ill-thought out Notices of Preliminary Objection. Each set of Respondents, that is the 1st - 3rd Respondents on one hand and the 4th Respondent on the other, shall pay costs assessed at N600,00.00 to the Appellant.  Appeal allowed.   OLABODE RHODES-VIVOUR, J.S.C.:  I had the advantage of reading in draft a copy of the leading judgment prepared by my learned brother EKO, JSC.  I agree that the appeal should be allowed, and I endorse the order on costs as proposed in the leading judgment.   MARY UKAEGO PETER-ODILI, J.S.C.:  I agree with the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Ejembi Eko JSC and to underscore the support in the reasonings from which the decision emanated, I shall make some comments.  This is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Ado-Ekiti Division delivered on 11th July 2018, Coram: A. B. Belgore, F. O. Akinbami and P. O. Elechi JJCA otherwise called the Court below or Lower Court.  BRIEF STATEMENT OF FACTS: Sometime in the year 2007, the Appellant was granted title to a parcel of land measuring 26.672 hectares along Ikare Road, Ado-Ekiti for the purpose of building a five star hotel. As evidence of the grant, a Certificate of Occupancy was issued to the appellant in the year 2008.  Subsequently, the Certificate above mentioned was withdrawn and another one was issued in its place in the year 2011, but registered in the year 2012. Both Certificates contained terms and conditions including a term requiring the appellant to pay annual rent in the sum of N691,450,00 Six Hundred and Ninety One Thousand, Four Hundred and Fifty Naira in relation to the Certificate of 2008 and the sum of N6,668,000.00 for the Certificate of 2011 also inclusive in the terms of the grant was that the appellant must erect and complete the building on the land in line with Government approved building plans within 2 years of the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. The appellant failed to comply with the terms of the grant particularly as it related to the payment of ground rent and development of the land within 2 years of the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy, consequent upon which the 1st Respondent by notice of revocation dated 16th October 2014 contained at page 202 of volume 1 of the record of appeal revoked the Appellant's right of occupancy and subsequently awarded the said parcel of land to the 4th Respondent.  In October 2016, the Notice of Revocation was published in a newspaper. Aggrieved that the notice of revocation was served or made known to it through the dailies, the appellant by writ of summons commenced this action at the Ekiti State High Court challenging the said revocation.  Deducible from the statement of claim is that the Appellant failed to plead payment of ground rent from 2007 - 2012. The appellant also pleaded that it erected a fence on the land between February and April 2015 outside the 2 years period for development contained in the Certificate.  Premised on the foregoing, upon being served with the writ of summons and statement of claim, the 1st - 3rd Respondents filed a preliminary objection challenging the competence of the action on the grounds inter alia, that the action is statute barred, the revocation having taken place on 16th December 2014 and that the suit discloses no reasonable cause of action. The 4th respondent also filed a preliminary objection along the same terms. The appellant filed a counter-affidavit denying receipt and or service of any notice of revocation in December 2014. Pursuant thereto, the 1st - 3rd respondents filed a further affidavit and attached Exhibit F a receipt evidencing payment for dispatch of the notice of revocation and Exhibit FBA1, proof of delivery of the said notice of revocation.  Before the hearing and determination of the objection of the respondents, the appellant filed an application which in content is an objection challenging the respondents' preliminary objections.  The learned trial Judge heard arguments on both objections and upheld the respondents objection that the action is statute barred, after finding as a fact that the appellant was served with the notice of revocation in December 2014.  Dissatisfied with the ruling of the Lower Court, the appellant appealed against same to the Court of Appeal, the Notice of Appeal is contained at pages 1035-1045 of the record. The Appeal was argued on 9th April 2018.  In a considered judgment delivered on 11th April, 2018, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the finding of fact by the High Court that the appellant was indeed served with the notice of revocation in December 2014 and as such the action is statute barred.  Aggrieved, the appellant has come before this Apex Court on appeal.  On the 16th day of December, 2019 date of hearing, learned counsel for the Appellant, Peter Nwatu Esq., adopted the brief of argument settled by Robert Emukpoeruo Esq., filed on 1522019 and deemed filed on 15519. He distilled seven 7 issues for determination which are as follows:- 1. Whether the Court below was right when it held that the appellant did not raise any issue relating to the property andor value of Exhibits E, F, and FBA1 attached to the Affidavit and Further and Better Affidavit in support of the 1st-3rd Respondents' Notice of Preliminary Objection, and Exhibits D, E and F attached to the Affidavit and Further and Better Affidavit in support of the 4th Respondent's Notice of Preliminary Objection filed in the trial Court. Distilled from Ground 1. 2. Whether the Court below was right when it held that the appellant was served Notice of Revocation of its Right of Occupancy in December, 2014. Distilled from Ground 2. 3. Whether the Court below was right when it held that the appellant's cause of action accrued on 22nd December, 2014 and that the suit leading to the instant appeal is statute barred. Distilled from Ground 3. 4. Whether the Court below was right when it held that the appellant's disclosed no reasonable cause of action. Distilled from Ground 4. 5. Whether in the case at hand and on the doctrine of stare decisis, the Court below was not bound to follow the decisions of this noble Court in the cases of Napoleon Orianzi v. Attorney General of Rivers State 2017 6 NWLR pt.1561 p.224 at Pp.272, Paras, C- D, 296, paras B-C; Osho v. Foreign Finance Corporation 1991 4 NWLR Pt.184 157 at 194; Attorney General of Lagos State v. Sowande 1992 8 NWLR pt.261 p.589 at Pp.601-602; Mulima v. Usman 2014 16 NWLR Pt.1432 160 at 212 and Attorney General of Rivers State v. Attorney General of Bayelsa State 2013 3 NWLR pt.1340 123 at 150 on the mandatory requirements for a valid revocation of a right of Occupancy and the exceptions to the applicability on Section 2 a of Public Officers Protection Act, Distilled from Ground 5. 6. Whether the Court below was right when it discountenanced and failed to consider the Appellant's Reply Briefs of Argument on the ground that they are a re-argument of the appeal. Distilled from Ground 6. 7. Whether the Court below did not breach the appellant's right to fair hearing when it failed to consider and determine Issues 4, 5 and 6 of the Appellant's brief of Argument. Distilled from Grounds 7 and 8.  Appellant filed two reply briefs each against 1st - 3rd respondents and 4th respondent respectively on 11102019 and deemed filed on 141019.  Olalekan Olatawura Esq., learned counsel for the 1st-3rd respondents adopted the brief of argument filed on 2852019 and deemed filed on 141019 and also adopted the issues as crafted by the appellant.  Oluwasina Ogungbade adopted the brief of argument of 4th respondent, filed on 2752019 and deemed filed on 14102019 and in it raised five issues for determination of the appeal which are thus:- i.Having regard to the failure of the appellant to file a further counter affidavit to contradict the 4th respondent's assertion that the appellant was served the mandatory Notice of Revocation, was the Court of Appeal wrong to have upheld the trial Court's decision that the appellant's suit was statute - barred by operation of the Public Officers' Protection Act. Grounds 1, 2 and 3. ii. Whether the Court of Appeal was not right when, upon a consideration of the pleadings filed by the appellant before the trial Court, it held that the appellant's case disclosed no reasonable cause of action. Ground 4. iii. Whether the cases of Orianzi v. A.G. Rivers 2017 6 NWLR Pt.1561 244 at 272; Osho v. Foreign Finance Corporation 1991 4 NWLR pt.184 157 at 194; A.G. Lagos v. Sowande 1992 8 NWLR Pt.261 589 at 601; Mulima v. Usman 2014 16 NWLR Pt.1432 160 at 212 and A.G. Rivers State v. A.G. Bayelsa State 2013 3 NWLR Pt.1340 123 at 150, all heavily relied upon by the appellant, are applicable to the facts of this case. Ground 5. iv. Whether given the re-argumentative nature of the appellant's Reply Brief, the Court of Appeal did not rightly discountenance same, Ground 6. v. Whether the refusal of the Court of Appeal to venture into a mere academic exercise by considering Issues 4, 5 and 6 of the Appellant's Brief of Argument amounts to a denial of fair hearing. Grounds 7 and 8.  I shall utilise the issues as crafted by the 4th respondent except for Issue iii. i. Having regard to the failure of the appellant to file a Further Counter Affidavit to contradict the 4th respondent's assertion that the appellant was served the mandatory Notice of Revocation, was the Court of Appeal wrong to have upheld the trial Court's decision that the appellant's suit was statute-barred by operation of the Public Officers' Protection Act? ii. Whether the Court of Appeal was not right when, upon a consideration of the pleadings filed by the appellant before the trial Court, it held that the appellant's case disclosed no reasonable cause of action. iv. Whether given the re-argumentative nature of the appellant's Reply Brief, the Court of Appeal did not rightly discountenance same. v. Whether the refusal of the Court of Appeal to venture into a mere academic exercise by considering Issues 4, 5 and 6 of the appellant's Brief of Argument amounts to a denial of fair hearing.  Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that contrary to the decision of the Court below, that the appellant at the trial Court, unequivocally raised serious issues relating to, and indeed challenged the propriety andor probative value of the touted Exhibits E, R and FBA1, and Exhibits D, E and F attached to the Affidavits and Further and Better Affidavits in support of the respondent's Notice of preliminary Objection.  That there were serious conflicts in the affidavits that needed to be resolved and not having been done vitiated the decision at the Courts below especially since there was no oral evidence to so resolve those conflicts. Also, that some parts of the affidavit depositions that were patently false and ought not to have been used to reach the decisions made at the Court below. He cited F.S.B. International Bank Ltd. v. Imano Nig. Ltd. 2000 11 NWLR Pt.679 620 at 635-636; Okoebor v. Police Council 2003 5 SC 1...1; Okafor v. Igbo 1991 8 NWLR pt.210 476 CA etc.  For the appellant, it was contended that the 1st respondent did not serve any notice of revocation on the appellant as mandatorily required by the combined provisions of Sections 28, 29 and 44 of the Land Use Act and so the purported revocation was null and void. He cited Osho v. Foreign Finance Corporation 1991 4 NWLR Pt.184 157 at 194; Orianzi v. A. G. Rivers State 2017 6 NWLR Pt.1561 224 at296 etc.  Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the Public Officers Protection Act does not apply to the case in hand and does not avail any of the respondents in that the appellant commenced the action which led to the present appeal within 3 months, reckoned from 14th November, 2016 when the appellant's cause of action arose. He cited Egbe v. Adefarasin 1987 1 NWLR Pt.47 1 at 20; Woherem v. Emereuwa 2004 6-7 SC 161 etc. That the action is not statute barred.  It was further submitted for the appellant that the suit leading to the present appeal as constituted in the writ of summons and the statement of claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action upon which the Lower Court can adjudicate. He relied on Rinco Construction Co. v. Veepee Ind. Ltd. 2005 9 NWLR pt.929 85 at 96 etc.  Learned counsel for the appellant stated on that the Court below discountenanced the appellant's reply brief and in failing to consider the same in determining the appeal thereby denying the appellant of his right to fair hearing. He cited Kalu v. State 2011 4 NWLR Pt.1238 429 at 448 etc.  Also contended by the appellant is that the trial Court made far reaching pronouncements on the substance of the matter before taking evidence and so prejudged and determined the entire case in limine and at the interlocutory stage. He cited Onyesoh v. Nnebedun 1992 3 SCNJ 129 etc.  Learned counsel for the 1st-3rd respondents submitted that it is not correct as stated by the appellant that appellant did not raise any issue relating to the propriety andor the probative value of Exhibits E, F and FBA1, and so it is late in the day now to so raise that issue without leave of Court. He cited Oseni v. Bajulu & Ors. 2009 LPELR-2796 SC; Ibikunle v. The State 2007 LPELR- 8068 SC etc.  That there were no conflicts in the affidavit and further and better affidavit of 1st - 3rd respondents and the counter affidavit of the appellant to warrant the calling of oral evidence by the trial Court and that assuming there had been conflicts, the documentary evidence proffered were sufficient for the Court's utilisation in resolving such conflict. He cited Bawa v. Phenias 2007 4 NWLR Pt. 1024 251 at 267-269 etc.  That the Court below was right to have held that the appellant did not raise any issue relating to the propriety andor probative value of Exhibits E, F, FBA1 attached to the affidavit and the further and better affidavit in support of the 1st - 3rd respondents preliminary objection at the trial Court and cannot do so at the Court below without the leave of Court.  That the Certificate of Occupancy granted the appellant was properly revoked and the concurrent findings of the two Courts below ought not be interfered with by this Court. He cited Obidike v. State 2014 LPELR-22590 SC; Ojo & Ors. v. Anibire & Ors. 2004 LPELR -2378 SC.  Learned counsel for 1st-3rd respondents submitted that Public Officers Protection Act, Section 2 a applied to sustain position of the respondents.  That a careful consideration of the case presented by the appellant vide its writ of summons and Statement of Claim will reveal that the appellant's suit does not disclose a reasonable cause of action as found by the Court below. He citedShell PDC Ltd. & Anor. v. X. M. Federal Limited & Anor. 2006 LPELR -3047 SC.  He stated for 1st-3rd respondents that the revocation of the land was duly done within the provision of Sections 28 and 44 of the Land Use Act. Also that there was service of notice of revocation made properly on the appellant and so the issue of denial of fair hearing does not arise and the re-allocation done within the law. He cited many judicial authorities.  It was further submitted for the 1st-3rd respondents that the Court below was correct in holding that the action was statute barred. He relied on Odom & Ors v. PDP & Ors. 2015 LPELR P.56.  The arguments of learned counsel for the 4th respondent were along the same lines as those of the 1st-3rd respondents.  In reply on points of law, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the present case falls within the category of cases of concurrent findings of fact where the Supreme Court should interfere with and disturb.  In a nutshell, the appellant urges the Court to allow the appeal while resolving the issues for determination in favour of the appellant. The 1st-3rd respondents reminded the Court of the notoriety of the policy not to disturb concurrent findings of fact of two Courts below except in special circumstances which in this instance do not exist. The 4th respondent sought a line of persuasion for the dismissing of the appeal as lacking in merit.  On whether the Court of Appeal was right when it held that the appellant was served the Notice of Revocation of the Right of Occupancy in December 2014, that appellate Court held thus:- \"Attempts were made to question the veracity and probative value of Exhibits E, F and FBA1 attached to the 1st-3rd Respondents' Further and Better Affidavit, which Exhibits are the same as Exhibit D, E and F attached to the 4th Respondent's Further and Better Affidavit in support of the Preliminary Objection... The appellant did not raise any issues at the lower Court, relating to the propriety andor probative value of the said Exhibits, and if it did, it was only part of counsel's address which did not constitute evidence... The learned trial Judge was right to have found that the appellant was served with the letter of revocation of its Right of Occupancy in December, 2014, on the basis of Exhibits E, F and FBA1 attached to the Further and Better Affidavit of the 1st-3rd respondents, sic on the one handy and Exhibits D, E, and F attached to the Further and Better Affidavit of the 4th Respondent.\"  From the record, it is seen that the appellant raised serious issues relating to and in fact challenged the propriety andor probative value of the Exhibits E, F and FBA1 and Exhibits D, E and F attached to the Affidavits and Further and Better Affidavits in support of the respondents' Notices of Preliminary Objection. For clarity and to leave nothing to chance, I shall refer to the averment of David Ogundipe in Paragraph 10 i ii iii iv and vi of the appellants counter-affidavit filed as the trial Court on 632017 in opposition to the 1st-3rd respondents' Notice of Preliminary Objection which depositions are thus:- \"10. That contrary to Paragraphs 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the Affidavit, the ClaimantRespondent states as follows:- i. that the ClaimantRespondent was never served any Notice of Revocation of its Right of Occupancy by the 1st defendant or any of its agencies. ii. that the claimantrespondent only became aware that its Right of Occupancy over the said land has been revoked vide a publication in the Nigerian Tribune Newspaper of 14th November, 2016, after the actual revocation had been carried out vide the 1st defendant's official Gazette of 20th October, 2016. Now shown to me and marked Exhibits C and C1 and copies of the said Nigerian Tribune Newspaper and the 1st defendant's Official Gazette.  iii. that Exhibits E and F attached to the 1st-3rd defendantapplicant's affidavit in support of Notice of preliminary Objection are complete afterthought, and merely improvised in contemplation of this suit. iv. that there is no nexus whatsoever between Exhibit E and the 1st to 3rd defendants, in that it is neither shown to have proceeded from the 1st, 2nd or 3rd defendants nor signed by an officer of the 1st, 2nd or 3rd defendants. v. that except oral evidence is called and the purported Exhibits E and F are demonstrated during trial, the issue cannot be resolved at an interlocutory stage.\"  Similarly, the appellant, vide Paragraph 9 i ii iv v vi vii viii ix x xi x and xii of its counter-affidavit in opposition to the 4th respondent's notice of preliminary objection sworn to by David Ogundipe and filed in the trial Court on 06032017, challenged the propriety andor probative value of Exhibits D, E and a fortiori, Exhibit F attached to the affidavit and further and better affidavit in support of the 4th respondent's notice of preliminary objection in the manner below: 9.\"That contrary to paragraphs 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the affidavit, the claimantrespondent states as follows:- i. that the claimantrespondent was never served any Notice of Revocation of its Right of Occupancy by the 1st Defendant or any of its agencies. ii. that the claimantrespondent only became aware that its right of occupancy over the said land has been revoked vide a publication in the Nigerian Tribune Newspaper of 14th November, 2016, after the actual revocation had been carried our vide the 1st defendant's official gazette of 20th October, 2016. Now shown to me and marked Exhibits B and B1 and copies of the said Nigerian Tribune Newspaper and the 1st defendant's official gazette. iii. That the 1st defendant purportedly revoked the claimant's right of occupancy in bad faith. iv. that I know as a fact that Exhibits D and E attached to the 4th defendantappellant's affidavit in support of Notice of Preliminary Objection are complete afterthought, and merely improvised. v. that the fallacy and falsehood with which Exhibits D and E are infested is evident in the fact that they were stated to have been purportedly served on the claimant since 2014, yet the 1st defendant waited till two years after in 2016 before purportedly revoking the claimant's right of occupancy purportedly on the basis of the non-existent Exhibits D and E. vi. that Exhibits D and E do not exist and were never served on the claimant. vii. that Exhibit D neither bears the letter head of the 2nd defendant from whom it purportedly proceeded nor shown to have been signed by any officers in the 2nd defendant's ministry. viii. that there is no nexus whatsoever between Exhibit D and the 2nd defendant. ix. that the signatory of Exhibit D is unknown to the 2nd Defendant from whom Exhibit D purportedly proceeded. x. that Exhibit D when juxtaposed with Exhibit C attached to the affidavit in support of the 4th defendant's notice of preliminary objection purportedly proceeding from the same source, shows a patent, glaring and irreconcilable inconsistency and conflict. xii. that except oral evidence is called and the purported Exhibits D and E are demonstrated during trial, the issue cannot be resolved at an interlocutory state.  The appellant not only raised the foregoing questions relating to the propriety andor probative value of the aforementioned Exhibits, it also attached Exhibits B, B1 and C, C1 the Nigerian Tribune Newspaper of 14th November. 2016, and the 1st defendant's official gazette of 20th October, 2016 which effectively debunked the purport andor probative potencyvalue if any, of the aforementioned Exhibits E, F, FBA1 on the one hand and D, E and F on the other hand attached to the respondent's affidavits in support of their Notice of preliminary objection. Again, it is abundantly clear that Exhibits FBA1 and F attached to the Further and Better Affidavits in support of the respondent's notice of preliminary objection are like Siamese twins with and inseparable from Exhibits E and F, D and E respectively attached to the affidavits in support of the respondent's Notice of preliminary Objection. This is because Exhibits FBA1 and F are merely purported of dispatchdelivery of Exhibits E and D the purported notice of revocation. Accordingly, an attackchallenge on Exhibits FBA1 and F. The corollary therefore, is that having effectively controverted and indeed, challenged, though its counter affidavits to the respondent's objections, the propriety andor probative value of Exhibits E and D attached to the respondents' affidavits in probative value of Exhibits FAV1 and F.  From those depositions in the appellant's counter affidavits filed in the trial Court, it is difficult to go along with the Court below when it held that the appellant did not raise any issue relating to the propriety andor probative value of Exhibits E, F and FBA1 attached to the affidavit and further and better affidavit in support of the 1st -3rd respondent's notice of preliminary objection, which are the same as Exhibit D, E and F attached to the affidavit and further and better affidavit in support of the 4th respondent's notice or preliminary objection. It must be noted that the holden of the Court below that the appellant was served notice of revocation of its right of occupancy was premised solely on Exhibits E, F, FBA1 on the one hand and D, E, and F on the other hand attached to the respondent's affidavits in support of their notice of preliminary objection, and the erroneous finding of the lower Court that the appellant did not raise any issues relating to the proprietary andor privative value of same. Having demonstrably and unassailably shown in the preceding paragraphs, that the appellant indeed, not only challenged the propriety andor probative value of the aforesaid Exhibits, but also attached Exhibit B, B1 and C, C1 the Nigerian Tribune Newspaper of 14th Novenber, 2016, and the 1st defendant's official gazette of 20th October, 2016 which effectively debunked the purport andor probative potency, if any, of the aforementioned Exhibits E, F and FBA1 and D, E and F, it is submitted that the appellant was never served any notice of revocation of its right of occupancy. Accordingly, the findingholden of the lower Court in this regard is perverse and we urge your Lordships to set same aside, ex debito justicae.  A perfunctory glance at Exhibits FBA1 and F attached to the 1st-3rd respondent's further and better affidavit in support of their notice of preliminary objection and the document described at Exhibit F attached to the Further and Better Affidavit in support of the 4th respondent's notice of preliminary objection both filed at the trial High Court, overtly reveal the desperation of the respondents to establish service of notice of revocation on the appellant by all means humanly possible. Thus, Exhibit F and FBA1 EMS Speed post Delivery Form the alleged receipt of which on behalf of the appellant was purportedly acknowledged by one Gbemisola, whose identity, designation and capacity in the appellant is unknown and so remains a strange document to the appellant and was never served on the appellant or any of its agents, servants, assigns or privies.  It is difficult not to agree with the appellants that except oral evidence is called and the facts and averments giving rise to the findings and decision of the two Courts below, as well as the purported Exhibit D, E, F and FBA1 are demonstrated during trial, the issues cannot be resolved in limine andor at an interlocutory stage. It was indeed incumbent on the trial Court, in the face of these material conflicts to call oral evidence to resolve the conflicts. See Okafor v. Igbo 1991 8 NWLR Pt.210 P.476 where Katsina- Alu, JCA as he then was held at Pp.483, paras. F-H, Para. A as follows:- \"There is no general discretion in the judge to call a witness in a civil dispute whom he thinks might throw some light on the facts. However, a judge has the power and indeed the duty to call oral evidence to resolve some conflict in affidavit evidence. He has a duty to resolve the conflict if he is to make a finding even where the parties did not initiate it. See A.O. Uku & Ors. v. D. E. Okumagba 1974 3 SC 35; Falobi v. Falobi 1976 9-10 SC 1 at 15. His discretion to call a witness in this regard should not and must not be confined to the parties who would do no more than merely repeat the averments in their affidavits. He must then give leave to counsel to cross examine. It is plain, on the facts, that this is what the learned trial judge did in the present case. I think the judge was right to call for oral evidence to resolve the conflict.\" Underlining and italics supplied for Emphasis. See also this Court's decision in F.S.B, International Bank Ltd v. Imano Nig. Ltd. 2000 11 NWLR Pt.679 P.620 at P.635-636 paras H-E: 637, Paras. A-B, B-D, where Achike JSC had this to say: \"Conflicts in affidavit evidence on fundamental issues to the matters in controversy must be attended to and not just glossed over. A Court of law - be it trial or appellate - is not imbued with divine or magical powers in the sense that it can divinely or magically resolve conflicts in factual matters which may only be done, in certain circumstances, by a dispassionate and painstaking evaluation of the facts or evidence placed before the Court. When a Court is faced with affidavits which are irreconcilably in conflict, the Judge hearing the case in order to resolve the conflict properly, should first hear oral evidence from the deponents or such other witnesses as at the parties may be advised to call. In the instant case, as there was a sharp dispute as to the capacity in which the appellant signed the promissory notes, it behooved the learned trial judge to have called oral evidence on the matter, instead to giving summary judgment against the appellant. In the interest of justice, it ought to be conceded that the appellant has produced strong prima facie assertions and affidavit evidence which should be evaluated against the respondent's assertions and affidavit evidence. IT SURELY DEMANDS, IN LAW, EITHER CALLING ORAL EVIDENCE TO RESOLVE THE AREAS OF CONFLICT IN THE AFFIDAVIT EVIDENCE AND OTHER FACTUAL ASSERTIONS OR, PERHAPS, BETTER STILL, TO ACCORD THE PARTIES A HEARING OF THE ACTION ON THE MERIT WHICH WILL FACILITATE THE RESOLUTIONS OF AREAS OF CONFLICT.\"  In the case at hand, the trial Court failed to call oral evidence to resolve the glaring material conflicts in the parties' affidavits, even when the appellant urged the Court to be circumspect in proceeding without doing so. The Court below, in grave error, approved this failure on the part of the trial Court. The corollary is that by making positive pronouncements on the basis of the above referenced Exhibits D, E, F and FBA1, the trial Court and the Court below prejudged the real matter even before evidence was led and arguments of counsel were marshaled on the substantive suit which was commenced by writ of summons. See OGBONNAYA & ORS. v. ADAPALM NIGERIA LTD 1993 LPELR-2288 SC, Bakare v. Bakare 2012 16 NWLR Pt.29 at 49 - 50.  One cannot ignore the manifest discrepancies, conflicts which were irreconcilable with which Exhibits D, E, F and FBA1 are plagued and so the trial Court cannot act on them as evidence of service of notice of revocation on the appellant and in that wise the decisions of the Courts below based on those clearly unreliable exhibits cannot stand in the light of the provisions of Sections 28, 29 and 44 a e of the Land Use Act as well as Section 44 1 a and b of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended.  For clarification, I shall quote 28 1 4 6 7 and 44 a - e of the Land Use Act provide as follows:- 28 1\"It shall be lawful for the Governor to revoke a right of occupancy for overriding public interest. 4 The Governor shall revoke a right of occupancy in the event of the issue of a notice by or on behalf of the President if such notice declares such land to be required by the Government for public purposes. 6 The revocation of a right of occupancy shall be signified under the hand of a public officer duly authorized in that behalf by the Governor and notice thereof shall be given to the holder. 7 The title of the holder of a right of occupancy shall be extinguished on receipt by him of a notice given under Subsection 6 of this Section or on such later date as may be stated in the notice. 44 \"Any notice required by this Act to be served on any person shall be effectively served on him - a by delivering it to the person on whom it is to be served; or b by leaving it at the usual or last known place of abode of the person; or c by sending it in a prepaid registered letter addressed to that person at his usual or last known place of abode; or d in the case of an incorporated company or body, by delivering it to the secretary or clerk of the company or body at its registered or principal office or sending it in a prepaid registered letter addressed to the secretary or clerk of the company or body at that office; or e if it is not practicable after reasonable inquiry to ascertain the name or address of a holder or occupier of land on whom it should be served, by addressing it to him by the description of \"holder\" or \"occupier\" of the premises naming them to which it relates, and by delivering it to some person on the premises or, if there is no person on the premises to whom it can be delivered, by affixing it, or a copy of it, to some conspicuous part of the premises.\"  The views in relation to those statutory provisions are stated hereunder thus:- In Nigerian Engineering Works Ltd v. Denap Ltd, 2001 18 NWLR Pt.746 P. 741, this Court held that pursuant to Section 44 of the Land Use Act, the requisite notice of revocation shall be effectively and validly served as provided under Section 44 a - e of the Act, and that failure to serve same renders any purported revocation null and void. See also The AdministratorsExecutors of the Estate of Gen, Sanni Abacha v. Eke-Spiff 2009 1 NWLR Pt.800 P.114; Ononuju v. A.G. Anambra State 1998 11 NWLR Pt.573 P.320 - 322. In the instant case, neither the 1st respondent nor any of its agencies served the appellant any notice of revocation before purporting to revoke its Right of Occupancy, in flagrant breach of the above mandatory provisions of the law. Thus, in Inakoju v. Adeleke 2007 4 NWLR Pt.1025 P.423, this Court held as follows:- \"The Courts are bound to enforce the mandatory provisions of a substantive law including the constitution. It is the duty of all Courts to give effect to legislation. Therefore, parties cannot by consent or acquiescence or failure to object, nullify the effect of a statute or constitution. In other words, it is the duty of a Court to enforce mandatory provision of an enactment.\"  I also refer to the case of Nwokoro v. Onuma 1990 3 NWLR Pt.136 22 at 32 where Karibi- Whyte, JSC held as follows:- \"It is a fundamental principle of legality that where an act or course of conduct fails to meet with the requirements prescribed by law, such that the non-compliance renders the act or course of conduct devoid of legal effect, no legal consequences flow from such acts or course of conduct.\" Underlining supplied for emphasis.  At the risk of repetition, the law provides for the modemethod to be followed in doing an act, that mode, and no other, must be strictly followed. Accordingly, in Okpalauzuebgu v. Ezemenari 2011 14 NWLR pt.1268 492 at 524-525, paragraphs G - A, it was held as follows:- \"Where a law or legislation has set out the procedure for doing a thing, there should be no other method of doing it.\" See also the case of APAPA v. INEC 2012 8 NWLR pt.1303 409 at 431 Para. B; GALAUDU v. KAMBA 2004 15 NWLR pt.95 31; INAKOJU v. ADELEKE 2000 4 NWLR pt.1025 423. Similarly, in ABUBAKAR v. NASAMU No.2 2012 17 NWLR Pt. 1330 P.407 at P.590, Para. H, this Honourable Court, per Ngwuta, JSC aptly stated the law thus:- \"I entirely agree with the argument and authorities relied on by the respondents to the effect that when the law has specified the mode of doing an act or following a step in a proceeding, that mode must be strictly complied with. There can be no issue on this point.\" Again, in CSS BOOKSHOPS LTD. v. R.T.M.C.R.S. 2006 LPELR-824 SC 2006 11 NWLR pt.992 530, per Tobi, JSC captured the jurisprudential basis of Notice of Revocation thus:- \"In exercising the Governor's power of revocation, there must be due compliance with the provisions of the Act, particularly with regard to giving of adequate notice of revocation to the holder whose name and address are well known to the public officer acting on behalf of the Governor. The purpose of giving notice of revocation of a right of occupancy is to duly inform the holder thereof of the steps being taken to extinguish his right of occupancy. In the absence of notice of revocation of right of occupancy, it follows that the purported revocation of the right of occupancy by the officer duly authorized by the Governor is ineffectual.\" See also Nigerian Telecommunications Limited v. Chief Ogunbiyi 1992 7 NWLR Pt.255 543; Ononuju v. A.G. Anambra State 1998 11 NWLR Pt.573 305 at 320 - 322; Ekundayo & Anor. v. FCDA & Anor. 2015 LPELR-24512 CA; Adukwu v. Commissioner of Works, Lands & Transport, Enugu State 1997 2 NWLR Pt.489 588, Case of NAPOLEON ORIANZI v. A. G., RIVERS STATE 2017 6 NWLR Pt.1561 P.224 at 296, Paras B-C, wherein this Court held that in revoking a right of occupancy, \"the title holder is not only entitled to the notice of the proposed revocation with the public purpose for the revocation of his title.\"  The legal effect of the clear illegality and statutory breach with which the 1st respondent acted in purporting to revoke the appellant's right of occupancy over the land in dispute without notice, without hearing from the appellant or any of its principal officers, and thereupon reallocated the same Right of Occupancy to the 4th Respondent, a private entity is aptly captured in the holden of Obaseki, jSC in Osho v Foreign Finance Corporation 1991 4 NWLR Pt.184 157 at 194 wherein the erudite jurist held thus:- \"An acquiring authority cannot rob Peter to pay Paul by divesting one citizen of his interest in property and vesting the same in another.\" See also Orianzi v A.G., Rivers State supra at P.272, paras. C-D; The AdministratorsExecutors of the Estate of Gen. Sani Abacha v Samuel Eke-Spiff 2009 7 NWLR Pt.1139 P, 97 at Pp.130, Paras. A-E; 131, Paras. E-F; 132, Paras. A-B, per Aderemi, JSC.  I agree with the learned counsel for the appellant that appellant's cause of action accrued on the 14th day of November, 2016 when it became aware of the 1st respondent's revocation of the Right of Occupancy over the land in dispute by virtue of the writ of summons and statement of claim filed on 16th January, 2017 challenging the said revocation of its Right of Occupancy, which suit resulted in the current appeal. The case of Sifax Nig. Ltd v Migfo Nig. Ltd. 2018 9 NWLR Pt.1623 P. is apt for our purpose here and I quote:- \"At this stage, the issue is not whether these allegations are true or not; the issue is when the cause of action accrued, as gathered from the pleadings. The appellants say that it was when the fifth appellant was incorporated but, as the respondents rightly submitted, it is a well-established principle that the right of action accrues WHEN THE PERSON THAT SUES BECOMES AWARE of the wrong. See UBA v BTL Ind. 2006 19 NWLR 1013 61; Jallco v Owoniboys Tech. Services Ltd. 1995 4 NWLR Pt.391 534 and Mulima v Usman 2014 16 NWLR Pt.1432 160 at P.201, paras. F-G wherein Okoro JSC after noting the decision of this Court in UBN v Umeoduagu 2004 13 NWLR P.890 352 - I think it is only reasonable and just that a party only sues when he becomes aware that his right has been tampered with, for, as long as he is unaware that someone has dealt with his property inconsistent with his ownership, he cannot sue as you cannot shave a man's hair in his absence.\"  In UBN v Umeoduagu 2004 13 NWLR pt.B90 352 at P.369, paras. D-E, this Court hit the nail on the head as follows:- \"From the combination of facts given by the respondent, it is abundantly clear that he came to know about the whereabouts of the missing money when he conducted a search which took him to the Central Bank. It was then that he discovered that the money had been kept in the Central Bank in the appellant's name. The discovery has established a prima facie default by the appellant. It was only then that the cause of action has arisen and the respondent could institute a claim for recovery of the amount.\"  It is therefore abundantly clear that the suit which culminated in the instant appeal is not caught by the provision of Section 2 a of Public officers Protection Act, and therefore not statute barred, in that reckoned from 14th November, 2016 when the cause of action arose, to 16th January, 2017 when the appellant approached the trial Court, the said suit No. HAD0517 was filed within the 3 months limitation period stipulated in Section 2 a of Public Officers Protection Act, For ease of reference and consideration, Section 2 a of the Public Officers Protection Act provides as follows:- “2Where any action, prosecution, or other proceeding is commenced against any person for any act done in pursuance of execution or intended execution of any Act or law or of any public duty, or authority or in respect of any alleged neglect or default in the execution of any such act, law, duty or authority, the following provisions shall have effect: a the action, prosecution, or proceedings shall no lie or be instituted unless it is commenced within three months next after the act, neglect or default complained of, or in case of a continuance of damage or injury, within three months next after the ceasing thereof.\"  Clearly, the above provision of the Public Officers Protection Act does not apply to the instant case, and does not avail any of the respondents, in that the appellant commenced the action which led to the present appeal within 3 months, reckoned from 14th November, 2016 when the appellant's cause of action arose.  The timeless decision of this Court in Egbe v Adefarasin 1987 1 NWLR Pt.47 1 at p,20, laid down the judicial formula for determining whether or not a right of action is alive or barred by the provision of the statute of Limitation in force at the time of the institution of the cause or matter. In that case, this Court held as follows:- \"The period of limitation is determined by looking at the Writ of summons and Statement of Claim ONLY, to ascertain the alleged date the wrong in question which gave rise to the plaintiff's cause of action was committed and by comparing such date with the date on which the writ of summons was filed. If the time on which the writ of summons or statement of claim was filed is beyond the period allowed by the limitation law, the action is statute barred. What needs to be emphasized is that the determining facts are the averments in the plaintiff's writ of summons and statement of claim... \"  Similarly, in WOHEREM v EMEREUWA 2004 6-7 SC 161; 2004 13 NWLR Pt.890 398 at 417, this Court held that: \"For the purpose of determining whether or not an action is statute barred, the period of limitation is determined by looking at the Writ of Summons and the Statement of Claim Only. I will however add, where one has been filed. It is from either or both of these processes that one can ascertain the alleged date when the wrong in question is said to have occurred or been committed, thereby giving rise to the plaintiff's cause of action. When that ascertained date is compared with the date of the writ of summons or originating process was filed in Court, it can then be determined whether the action was instituted within the period allowed by law or outside it. When it is found that the action was instituted within the period allowed by law, the action is said to be competent and the Court has the jurisdiction to entertain same.\" See also Savannah Bank of Nigeria Ltd. v Pan Atlantic Shipping & Transport Agency Ltd.1987 1 NWLR Pt.49 212; Araka v Ejeagwu 2000 15 NWLR Pt.692 684; Egbe v Adefarasin 1987 1 NWLR Pt.47 1; Ibrahim v Judicial Service Commission 1998 14 NWLR Pt.584 1; Military Administrator, Ekiti State v Aladeyelu 2007 14 NWLR Pt,1055 619; A.G. Adamawa State & 15 Ors. v A. G. Federation 2005 18 NWLR Pt.958 P.581 at Pp.550, paras. B-E; 561. paras. E-F; 565, paras. E-G; Muhammed v Military Administrator, Plateau State 2001 16 NWLR pt.740 570; British Airways Plc v Akinyosoye 1995 1 NWLR pt.371 722.  It is no longer in dispute that time begins to run for the purpose of limitation law when the cause of action arose, that is, when the plaintiff becomes aware that his legal right has been breached by the defendant. In other words, time begins to run in this regard, when, there is in existence, a person who can sue and another who can be sued and when, to the knowledge of the plaintiff, all facts have happened which are material to be proved to entitle him to succeed. See this noble Court's decision in Michael Arowolo v Ifabiyi 2002 4 NWLR pt.757 356 at 377, 383, paras. A-D, per Iguh and Kalgo, JJSC; Bulli Coal Mining Co. v Osborne 1989 AC 351 at 363; Faroly Establishment v NNPC 20011 5 NWLR Pt.1241 P.457.  In the light of the foregoing and having regard to the facts chronicled in paragraphs 10 i ii iii iv and vi of the Appellant's Counter Affidavit in opposition to the 1st - 3rd Respondents' Notice of Preliminary Objection and paragraphs 9 i ii iv v vi vii viii ix x xi and xii of its counter affidavit in opposition to the 4th respondent's notice of preliminary objection, that the suit leading to the instant appeal is not in any way or manner caught by Section 2 a of Public Officers Protection Act, and therefore, not statute barred, having been instituted against the respondents within three 3 months, reckoned from 14th November, 2016 when the cause of action accrued. See pages 859 - 860 and 686 - 688 of Volume 1 of the Record. See also paragraphs 2.1.5 - 2.1.6 of the submissions proffered on Issue 1 above.  Indeed, Section 2 a of the Public Officers Protection Act is inapplicable to the case in hand, because the matter under discourse and review pertains to land which is an exception to the applicability of that provision.  In this regard, I place reliance on the decision of this noble Court in Mulima v Usman 2014 16 NWLR Pt.1432 160 at 212, paras. C - E, wherein it was held that:- \"Section 2 a of the Public Officers Protection Act does not apply in cases of recovery of land.\" Similarly, in A. G. Rivers State v A. G., Bayelsa State 2013 3 NWLR Pt.1340 123 at 150, this Honourable Court held thus: \"The protection afforded public officers under the Public Officers Protection Act does not apply in cases of recovery of land...\"  Also into the fray is that the suit leading to the instant appeal is an action founded on contract, in that the land allocated to the appellant by the 1st and 2nd respondents in consideration of the sum of N54,000,000.00 Fifty Four Million Naira Only paid by the appellant is a contractual arrangement between the parties. Also, the Certificate of Occupancy issued to appellant in 2012, by the 1st respondent registered as No. 67 at page 67 in Volume 68 of the Certificate of Occupancy registered in the Lands Registry office at Ado Ekiti on 4th day of May, 2012 contains terms and conditions which create a binding contract between the appellant and the 1st respondent. Thus, the applicable limitation Law is Section 4 1 of the Limitation Law of Ekiti State which provides as follows:- \"The following actions shall not be brought after the expiration of SIX YEARS from the date on which the cause of action accrued, that is to say - a actions founded on simple contract or not tort.\" See Tajudeen v C.I.P.S.B. 2010 4 NWLR pt.1184 325 at 339.  In Osun State Government v Dalami Nigeria Ltd. 2007 LPELR-2817 sc at P,13, paras. A-B, this noble Court, per Katsina-Alu JSC as he then was stated the law thus:- \"It is now settled law that Section 2 of the Public Officers Protection Act does not apply to cases of contract.\"  We also place reliance on the authorities of Nigerian Ports Authority v. Construzioni Generali Farsura Cogefar SPA & Anor. 1974 1 All NLR Pt.2 463; Energy Marine and Industrial Ltd v. Minister of the Federal Capital Territory & Anor. 2010 LPELR-1977 CA.  Learned counsel for the appellant contends that bad faith is also an exception to the application of Section 2 a of the Public Officers Protection Act, that posture is unassailable and I refer to the averments in paragraphs 24, 25, 26,28, 32, 33 and 34 of the Statement of Claim filed on 16012017 and paragraph 9 of the counter affidavit in opposition to the 4th respondent's Notice of preliminary objection filed" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The Appellant's statutory Right of Occupancy (R of O), the grant of which was evidenced by the Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) No. DG 00104/2007 registered in the Lands Registry office, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, was revoked and the revocation was published in the Ekiti State Government (1st Respondent's) official Gazette No. 1, Vol. 20 of 20th October, 2016. The Appellant, as the Plaintiff at State High Court, sitting at Ado Ekiti, challenged the revocation contending, inter alia, that the revocation was illegal, unconstitutional and a nullity and that it be declared that he remained vested with the R of O over the disputed land - the same having neither been extinguished nor in anyway affected in law by the purported revocation. He also sought a declaration that the subsequent re-allocation of the disputed plot of land to the 4th Respondent, a neighbor and alleged encroacher upon the land - who allegedly actively instigated the revocation of the Appellant's R of O, was illegal, unlawful and a nullity. The Appellant further sought a perpetual injunctive order to restrain the 1st - 3rd Defendants/Respondents from issuing any C of O to the 4th Respondent and/or restraining the 4th Defendant/Respondent from howsoever interfering with his structures built on the land. In the ALTERNATIVE claims, the Appellant sought a declaration that he was in no way in default or breach of any term, condition or obligation in the C of O for the grant of the R of O. The Appellant's Statement of Claim at the trial Court was specially endorsed on the writ of summons taken out on 16th January, 2017.  The Respondents, as Defendants, had by way of demurrer, contrary to Order 22 Rules 1 & 2 of the Ekiti State High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, filed Notices of Preliminary Objection on 1st February, 2017 supported by affidavits contending that the trial High Court lacked \"jurisdiction to entertain this action and pray(s) that the suit be struck out in limine\". The 1st - 3rd Respondents filed a joint Notice of preliminary objection, independent of the 4th Respondent predicated on the grounds that the suit - i. was \"statute barred having been brought outside of the three months period stipulated by Section 2 of the Public Officers Protection Act as the 1st to 3rd Defendants/Appellants issued the Claimant with notice of revocation via letter dated 16th December, 2014 on the ground that the Claimant breached Paragraph 4 of the Certificate of Occupancy. ii. disclosed no reasonable cause of action. In the supporting affidavit, particularly paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 thereof, the 1st - 3rd Respondents founded justification for their revoking the Appellant's R of O on the grounds that the Appellant had serially breached and violated the terms and conditions in the C of O under which the R of O was granted; that the Appellant, instead of paying ground rents, \"appealed for waiver which was not granted\" and was thereby in breach of paragraph 12(ii) of the C of O - Exhibit C. They further alleged that the Appellant was in breach of paragraph 4 of the C of O that enjoined the Appellant to erect and complete buildings in accordance with the approved building plans within two years. They admitted that the Appellant had merely built a perimeter fence round the disputed land. The Appellant opposed the Notices of Preliminary Objections.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  AYOBODE OLUJIMI LOKULO-SODIPE, J.C.A.: Delivering the Leading Judgment:  The appeal is against the judgment delivered on 2062005, by the High Court of Justice, Owerri Judicial Division, presided over by Hon. Justice A.O.H. Ukachukwu hereafter to be simply referred to as “the Lower Court” and “learned trial Judge” respectively.  The Appellant was the 3rd accused person in Charge No. HOWART2199. In the said charge, the Appellant and 3 others were charged with the offence of armed robbery contrary to Section 12a of the Robbery and Firearms Special Provisions Act, Cap. 398, Laws of Federation of Nigeria, 1990 hereafter to be simply referred to as “Cap. 398”. In the particulars of offence, the Appellant and the 3 other accused persons and other still at large; while armed with firearms were alleged to have robbed one John Nwokeocha and his passengers of one Mercedes Benz 911 Lorry with Registration No. AE 281 and money totaling N260,715.00, on 1731998 at Mgbee along Orlu-Urualla-Akaokwa Road in Orlu Judicial Division. The charge was read over to the accused persons including the Appellant on 1081999, and each of them pleaded not guilty thereto. The prosecution called 6 witnesses in the proof of its case against the Appellant and the other accused persons. The Appellant and each of the other accused persons, testified in their own behalf, and called no other witness. In its judgment, the Lower Court noted that the 1st accused person in the charge before it, namely John Okorie confessed to the crime and that the other accused persons Appellant inclusive in their evidence denied the charge. The judgment of the Lower Court spans pages 243-283 of the records of appeal. Therein, after an extensive review of the evidence placed before it, and evaluation of the oral evidence adduced by the prosecution and the accused persons as well as the statements made to the Police by the Appellant and other accused persons respectively, the Lower Court in the judgment appealed against, found the prosecution to have proved its case against the Appellant and 2 of the other accused persons beyond reasonable doubt. The said Court did not find the prosecution to have done this, in respect of the 4th accused person. Hence, the lower Court convicted the Appellant and 2 of the other accused persons of the offence preferred against them; and duly sentenced each of the Appellant and 2 of the other accused persons to death as mandated by the law under which they were charged. The 4th accused person in the charge having been found not guilty, was acquitted and discharged.  Dwelling specifically on the case of the prosecution as it relates to the Appellant on pages 275-281 of the records of appeal, the Lower Court stated: - “Finally the 3rd accused denied any involvement in the robbery. As in the case of the 1st and 2nd accused he did not call any witness, not any of who travelled with him to the market. For his address his counsel formulated two issues for determination by this Court. These are: Firstly - whether he was one of those who took part in the robbery and whether the defence of alibi does not avail him. Secondly - whether the extra judicial statement of the 3rd accused i.e. Exhibits G,L,M and N qualify as confessional statement. Since either of the issues determines the guilt or otherwise of the 3rd accused, I shall consider them together. Before that, let me state that the statements of the 3rd accused i.e. D.W.3 made on 17398, 20398, 24398 and 7598 were admitted in evidence as Exhibits G, L, M and N followed the ruling of this Court on 15th October, 1999 in a trial within trial by which the objection of counsel to the admission of the statement made 17th March, 1998 was over ruled. I am bound by that ruling. As part of his defence of alibi, the D.W.3 told this Court that he traveled to Lafia market in the morning of 17th March, 1998 and returned to Orlu between the hours of 11am and 12:00 noon of the same day. Apart from the fact that he could not call or mention as his witness any of the traders in whose company he traveled, I consider it impossible of a vehicle - a transport Mercedes 911 Lorry to travel to Lafia from Orlu and return within the time stated considering the state of the roads movement of the vehicle and time in the market by all traders. In his evidence, he mentioned the conductor of the vehicle in which he allegedly travelled and as against calling him as a witness he rather gave the Court the impression that the said conductor and his brothers gave him out to the Police Warden who arrested and took him to the Police Station Orlu where their older brother and owner of the Lorry-Dennis was sic already posted and discussing with the Police. The question might be asked why the plan to involve him? That calls up the issue of his arrest. As against the evidence of the P.W.4 Nicholas Okonkwo that he arrested him, and that of the Police that he was arrested by the villagers the 3rd accused D.W.3 insisted that he was arrested by the police traffic warden. The question may again be asked - what does the police or traffic warden lose by accepting that they arrested the 3rd accused even if outside sic: scene of the crime and further what does the P.W.4 gain by claiming a feat performed by the police after he earned the credit of arresting the 1st accused. Iroabuchi Okereke testified in this case as the P.W.3. He testified as to his escape into the bush and later return to watch the robbers as well as the operation loss of his N62,000.00 Sixty two Thousand Naira to the robber. He did not mention the D.W.3 or claim any part he played in his arrest. The question might again be asked what does he lose by openly assisting the police to effect his arrest if he saw him at the scene andor was certain he was one of those that robbed them. The D.W.3 testified that he was yet to off load his goods from the lorry before he left to see the captured robbers. Since he had nobody in mind as likely to have been arrested one would ask to know why the hurry to behold the robbers even at the risk of abandoning his goods in the vehicle. If the story of the D.W.3 is believed my view is that it emanated from an agitated mind. But I do not believe the story. I rather believe the account of the arrest of the 3rd accused D.W.3 as given by the P.W.4 Nicholas Okonkwo. My answer to the 2nd issues therefore is that the extra judicial statements of the D.W.3 i.e. Exhibits G,L,M and N qualified as confessional statements. I also hold as part of issue number one that the defence of alibi did not avail him. I accept the evidence of the P.W.4 as the true account of the arrest of the D.W.3 i.e. 3rd accused. I also hold that the statements of the D.W.3 Exhibits G,L,M and N corroborated in material details the statements of Joseph Anoke made 17th and 15th March, 1998 - Exhibits E and J respectively. I do not accept the 1st accused attempt to exclude him from participation in the robbery ....”  Suffice it to say, that having also considered the case of the 4th accused person, the Lower Court concluded its judgment thus: - “In the result, I find the 1st accused John Okorie, 2nd accused Samuel Akpa and 3rd accused Michael Ori guilty of armed robbery contrary to Section 12a of the Robbery and Firearms Special Provision Act 1990 as charged. I find the 4th accused Onu Njoku not guilty. He is acquitted and discharged.”  Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the Lower Court convicting him of the offence of armed robbery and sentencing him to death therefor, the Appellant initiated the instant appeal by lodging at the registry of the said Court, a notice of appeal dated 1942013 and filed on the same date, pursuant to the leave of this Court, granted on 1142013, extending the time within which the Appellant, was to appeal.  The notice of appeal contains 4 grounds of appeal. The grounds therein, shorn of their respective particulars read:- “GROUNDS OF APPEAL GROUND 1 ERROR IN LAW The trial High Court erred in law when it convicted the appellant despite the exculpatory evidence made in favour of the appellant by DW1 i.e. 1st accused person, John Okorie. GROUND 2 ERROR IN LAW The trial Court erred in law when it admitted and placed reliance on the statement of Joseph Anoke the trapped armed robbery suspect i.e. Exhibit E in convicting the appellant. GROUND 3 ERROR IN LAW The High Court of Imo State erred in law when it held that the defence of alibi did not avail the appellant i.e. Michael Ori. GROUND 4 The verdict is unreasonable unwarranted and unsupportable having regard to the evidence led at the trial.”  The reliefs which the Appellant seeks from this Court as contained in the notice of appeal are:  i an order allowing the appeal and setting aside the conviction and sentence of the Appellant as per the judgment of the Lower Court delivered on 2062005;and  ii an order discharging and acquitting the Appellant.  The appeal was entertained on 2712020, with learned counsel, P.C. Onuoha adopting the amended Appellant’s brief of argument dated 21122015, and filed on 2092019, but deemed as properly filed on 2392019, in urging the Court to allow the same.  Though the Respondent was served with the amended brief of argument of the Appellant on 2092019, and hearing notice in respect of the date fixed for the appeal i.e. 2712020 on 9122019, the Respondent was not represented by counsel in Court at the hearing of the appeal on 2712020. However, as the Respondent had earlier filed a brief of argument in the appeal, it was deemed as having been duly argued by the Respondent on the said brief. The Respondent’s brief of argument in question is dated 1222018, and filed on 2022018, but deemed to have been properly filed and served on 2222018.  In his amended brief of argument, the Appellant distilled for the determination of the appeal, the following issues: - “1Whether the trial Judge was right in relying on Exhibits \"E”, and “J\" in convicting the appellant despite the exculpatory evidence given in favour of the appellant by the 1st accused person, John Okore. 2 Whether the appellant was a party to the offence and whether the defence of alibi does not avail him. 3 Whether the extra-judicial statements of the appellant i.e. Exhibits \"G”, “L”, “M” and “N\" qualify as confessional statements and whether the trial Court was right in relying on same to convict the appellant.”  The issues which the Respondent formulated for the determination of the appeal, in its brief of argument are: - “i. Whether the prosecution by admissible evidence proved the offence of armed robbery against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt? ii. Whether the defence of alibi as raised by the Appellant during his address in Court can be available in law for the benefit of the Appellant?”  The issues formulated by the Respondent are broad enough to accommodate those formulated by the Appellant. Accordingly, the appeal will be resolved on the issues formulated by the Respondent even though the issues formulated by the Appellant will be considered under the two issues formulated by the Respondent, as considered appropriate.  APPELLANT’S ISSUES 1 AND 3: The Appellant argued his issues 1 and 3, together. These two issues in my considered view simply raise the question as to whether the Lower Court acted on admissible evidence in convicting the Appellant. The issues therefore will be considered together with issue 1, as formulated by the Respondent.  Dwelling on these issues, the Appellant submitted that it was wrong for the Lower Court to have relied on Exhibits \"E” and “J”, as well as Exhibits “G, L, M and N\", in convicting him. The portion of the judgment of the Lower Court the Appellant relied upon in this regard reads: - \"I also hold that the statements of DW3, i.e.Exhibits \"G, L, M and N\" corroborated in material details the statements of Joseph Anoke made on 17398 - i.e. Exhibits \"E and J\" respectively.\"  It is the stance of the Appellant that firstly, Exhibits \"E and J\" are confessional statements of Joseph Anoke wherein he admitted the offence and implicated him Appellant; while Exhibits \"G, L, M, and N\" are his 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th statements. The Appellant submitted that it is trite that where an accused person makes a confessional statement implicating a co-accused, the confession is only evidence against the accused person that made it and not evidence against his co-accused unless such co-accused adopts the confessional statement in question by word or conduct. That if an accused person however goes into the witness box and testifies on oath and repeats what he told the police in his statement, then his sworn evidence becomes evidence in the case for all purposes, even if it is against his co-accused. That in the instant case, the maker of Exhibits “E” and “J” never testified in Court as he died before the commencement of trial. It is the stance of the Appellant that it was therefore an error in law for the Lower Court to have convicted him on the statement of another accused person to the Police. That this is more so as the maker of Exhibits \"E & J\", was not subjected to cross-examination to test the veracity of his statements. The Appellant submitted that in the circumstances, Exhibits \"G, L, M and N, which are his statements cannot be corroborated by Exhibits \"E and J\",sic as was wrongly held by the Lower Court. This Court was urged to expunge Exhibits \"E and J\" because S. 294 of the Evidence Act, forbids the use of such statements.  Also, the Appellant having re-produced the holding of the Lower Court that: - “I do not accept the 1st accused attempt to exclude him the appellant from participating in the robbery\" submitted that the position of the Lower Court in this regard was wrong. It is the stance of the Appellant that there was sufficient evidence exculpating him from participation in the robbery. This is because i the 1st accused John Okore who confessed to the offence in Exhibits \"F and K\", told the lower Court during the trial within trial conducted in the case that Michael Ori the Appellant was not a member of their gang and ii also reiterated his position in this respect during the substantive trial while testifying as DW1. That DW1 admitted committing the offence with which he was charged and still told the lower Court that nobody in their gang was known as and called Michael Ori i.e. Appellant. Furthermore, that both John Okore 1st accused and Okechukwu Ori who died before the trial, stated that the Appellant was not a member of their gang. That in Exhibit \"G\" i.e. Appellant’s 1st statement he told the police timeously that he traveled to Lafia in Nasarawa State on the date of the offence i.e. 17398, and was not a party to the robbery.  That aside from this, it was mandatory for the Lower Court to have made a specific finding as to whether a confessional statement was actually made by an accused person before holding that the statement was retracted or before putting them into any use in convicting him Appellant. This is because, he Appellant raised the plea on nonestfactum as he denied ever making Exhibits \"L, M and N\" and maintained that they were written by the Police and brought to him to sign at gun-point. That the Lower Court in the circumstances was under a duty to have made a specific finding as to whether he Appellant actually made the confessional statements ascribed to him before holding that the said statements were retracted or before putting them into any use in convicting him Appellant. It is the stance of the Appellant that the Lower Court did not do this in respect of Exhibits \"L, M, and N\" before using them in convicting him.  This Court was urged by the Appellant to resolve his issues 1 and 3 in his favour.  Dwelling on these issues which in my considered view are subsumed in its issue 1, the Respondent having stated and set out the elements of the offence of armed robbery, submitted that the prosecution proved its case against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt. That it did this by the evidence accepted by the Lower Court. That this is more so as there was no reasonable doubt from the Appellant. The Respondent submitted to the effect that a trial Court is permitted by law to infer from the facts proved and other facts whatever is necessary to complete the element of guilt or establish innocence. That this is what the Lower Court did in the instant case. Hence, that apart from the acceptance of the confessional statements of the Appellant, the direct evidence of the PW4, regarding the involvement of the Appellant in the crime with which he was charged and which was accepted by the Lower Court, justified the adoption by the said Court of the involvement of the Appellant in the crime and therefore a true account as reflected in Exhibits “G”, “L”, “M”, i.e. confessional statement made by the Appellant. That the facts therein were corroborated by the extra judicial statements of one Joseph Anoke one of the suspects in the crime who died before arraignment. Reference was made to Exhibits “E” and “J”.  Posing the question as to the circumstances under which a trial Court can convict an accused based on his confessional statements, the Respondent gave the answer that this can be done upon a free and voluntary confessional statement once it is direct and positive, and satisfactorily proved before the trial Court. That such confessional statement alone, is sufficient to sustain conviction, even if there is no corroborative evidence. That a conviction based on a confessional statement that is properly proved, will not be quashed on appeal merely because it is based entirely on the evidence of confession by the Appellant. That what is important is for the trial Court to be satisfied. It is the stance of the Respondent that in the instant case, a trial within trial was conducted to determine voluntariness of the extra judicial statements of the Appellant and that the Lower Court ruled that they were voluntarily made and duly admitted them in evidence and marked them Exhibits “G”, “L”, “M”, and “N”. Having also catalogued other pieces of evidence in the case, it is the stance of the Respondent that the lower Court had before it sufficient corroborative evidence of the fact that the Appellant was one of the armed robbers even without the extra judicial statements of Joseph Anoke admitted in evidence as Exhibits “E” and “J”. In the circumstances, the Respondent further submitted that the Lower Court was right in finding the Appellant guilty of committing the offence as charged. This is not only because it was based on his Appellant’s confessional statements, marked Exhibits “G”, “L”, “M” and “N”whether or not corroborated by any other evidence but as they were free and voluntary confessions of guilt by the Appellant and direct and positive, and duly made and satisfactorily proved before the said Court by the prosecution witnesses. That what is important is that the Court must be satisfied and this was the position in the instant case. The Court was urged to resolve Appellant.s issues 1 and 3 as well as the first part of Appellant.s issue 2 against him.  APPELLANT.S ISSUE 2: Dwelling on this issue, it is the stance of the Appellant that the Lower Court was wrong when it held that the defence of alibi did not avail him. The Appellant predicated his stance in this regard, on the fact that although he raised a defence of alibi at the earliest opportunity, the police did not discharge the burden of investigating the said alibi. That though on pages 264-265 of the records of appeal, the prosecution adduced evidence that its witness investigated his Appellant.s alibi and found that he did not attend the market on the date of the robbery as he claimed or at all within the week, because the said witness did not see what he Appellant bought from the market, there is however no evidence on record as to how the alibi was investigated. That in any event, the 1st accused who confessed to the offence told the lower Court that he Appellant was not a member of their gang and that nothing connected him with the robbery. The Appellant also attacked the statement made by the Lower Court regarding the impossibility of a transport 911 lorry - to travel to Lafia from Orlu and return within the time stated considering the state of the roads, movement of the vehicle and time in the market by all traders\", in demonstrating that the defence of alibi availed him.  Stating to the effect that he sufficiently raised the defence of alibi, the Appellant submitted that the prosecution did not adduce evidence in disproving the same. That the Lower Court ought not to have rejected his Appellant.s defence of alibi given the fact that the prosecution adduced no evidence to show that the said alibi was investigated not to talk of disproving the same.  This Court was urged to resolve this issue in favour of the Appellant.  Dwelling on the aspect of Appellant’s issue 2 as it relates to the defence of alibi, the Respondent submitted that from the clear facts stated by the Appellant in his confessional statements, i.e. Exhibits “G, “L”, “M”. and “N”, in whatever form one looks them, and when read together with Section 7 of the Criminal Code Act, the only reasonable conclusion one can arrive at in law, is that the Appellant was a party to that armed robbery incident in respect of which he was convicted.  Stating that it is indeed true that the Appellant to be entitled to the beneficent effect of the defence of alibi, the Respondent submitted that he must however raise it at the earliest opportunity; preferably [in] his extra-judicial statement. That this is to afford the police an opportunity either to confirm or confute its availability. The Respondent also submitted that such defence of alibi, must be unequivocal as to the particulars of the Appellant’s whereabouts and those present with him. It is the stance of the Respondent that the Appellant raised his defence of alibi during his evidence in Court with some particulars that would have, if raised in his extra judicial statements to the police, led the prosecution to investigate the same. In other words, that the defence of alibi was not available to the Appellant.  The Respondent submitted that the Appellant knew that he was making a mockery of the defence of alibi in this case; hence, none of the individuals the Appellants claimed were with him and who were mentioned in his evidence before the Lower Court, was called by him as a witness in support of his defence of alibi. The Respondent submitted to the effect that in any case, the settled position of the law is that it is not enough for an accused to raise the defence of alibi at the stage of trial. He must give adequate particulars of his whereabouts at the time of the commission of the offence to assist the police to make a meaningful investigation of the alibi. Therefore, that the mere allegation by the Appellant that he was not at the scene is not enough. That in the instant case, the lower Court was left with only the way and manner the Appellant was arrested. That this was unchallenged and that this justified the finding of the said Court in respect of the guilt of the said Appellant. It is the stance of the Respondent that the evidence adduced by the prosecution, regarding how PW4 used the gang’s “criminal-family-slangs” was sufficient evidence that fixed the Appellant at the scene of the crime and that this not only logically but physically demolished the Appellant’s plea of alibi. In concluding, the Respondent urged this Court to dismiss the instant appeal and affirm the judgment of the lower Court.  The Respondent indeed rightly stated the elements of the offence of armed robbery in its brief of argument. They are essentially – i that there was a robbery or series of robberies;  ii that each of the robbery was an armed robbery; and  iii that the accused person was one of the persons that took part in the robbery.  The prosecution is enjoined by law to prove each of these elements beyond reasonable doubt to sustain a conviction for the offence of armed robbery. See the old cases of BOZIN v. THE STATE 1985 2 NWLR Pt. 8 455; and IKEMSON v. THE STATE 1989 NWLR Pt.110 455; and amongst many others, the recent cases of PEDRO v. STATE 2018 LPELR-44460 SC and GIKI v. STATE 2018 LPELR-43604SC.  The Respondent is also correct in respect of its position as to how an allegation of the commission of a criminal offence may be proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution against an accused person. This is because, the position of the law till date remains that the prosecution may prove the guilt of an accused person by the confessional statement of that accused person, by circumstantial evidence or by the evidence of eye witnesses of the crime. That the prosecution does not always need an eyewitness account to succeed in proving its case against an accused person if the charge can otherwise be proved. See amongst others the cases of IGABELE v. THE STATE 2006 6 N.W.L.R. PT. 975 100 and UDOR v. THE STATE 2014 LPELR-23064SC.  I am of the considered view that it is in the knowledge of the position which the law ascribes to a confessional statement that the Appellant in the instant appeal, is challenging the use to which the lower Court put his statements to the Police and particularly those he claimed the principle of non est factum applied to; and his stance regarding the wrongful reliance on the said statements by the lower Court to convict him.  In my considered view, the arguments which the Appellant has weaved around his statements admitted and marked Exhibits “L”, “M”, “N” bring to the fore the questions as to when a confessional statement can be said to have been properly admitted in evidence in the course of a trial as such, and once so admitted whether the Court must close its eyes to the same, because the maker has retracted the same in the course of his evidence before the trial Court.  Confession and its making are matters provided for under the Evidence Act. The law is clear from decided cases as to what a confessional statement is. Going by Section 28 of the Evidence Act, a confessional statement is a statement made at any time by a person charged with a crime, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that crime. Such a statement is admissible if it is direct and positive and relates to his own acts, knowledge or intention, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed the crime charged. See amongst many others the cases of AKPAN V STATE 1992 7 SCNJ 22 and AZABADA v. THE STATE 2014 LPELR-23017SC. This is why a statement made to the Police by an accused person in the course of Police investigation into a crime that is the subject matter of a charge before a Court and in which an accused person had admitted or suggested the inference that he committed the offence, is always relevant and will be admitted where the accused person does not deny the making of the statement voluntarily; andor where he denies making the statement at all. In a situation where an accused does not deny making a statement alleged by the prosecution to be confessional, but claims not to have made it voluntarily, then the requirement of the law is that such a statement is not admissible in evidence against the accused person unless it is shown by the prosecution that it was a voluntary statement. This must be done by the Court embarking on a trial within trial. This is to enable the trial Judge determine whether or not the prosecution has established that the statement containing the confession was made voluntarily; and to the extent that the Judge is so satisfied, the same will be admitted in evidence and duly marked as an exhibit tendered by the prosecution. See GBADAMOSI v. THE STATE 1992 NWLR Pt. 266465 and STATE v. IBRAHIM 2019 LPELR-47548SC. Similarly, it is the settled position of the law that a confessional statement which an accused person denies making at the point of its being tendered, is admissible in evidence despite the denial. See the cases of IKEMSON v. THE STATE supra, AWOPEJU v. THE STATE 2002 3 MJSC 141 and AMOS v. STATE 2018 LPELR-44694SC.  Having regard to the submissions of the Appellant highlighted hereinbefore, I am of the considered view that he is not challenging the correctness of the admission in evidence of Exhibits “L”, “M” and “N” because he did not make them voluntarily. In the same vein, the Appellant by excluding Exhibit “G”, in my considered view would appear to be saying that the principle of non est factum is not applicable to the said Exhibit. I have hereinbefore reproduced a portion of the judgment of the Lower Court that deals with the statements of the Appellant admitted in evidence in the instant case. The portion reads: - “Before that, let me state that the statements of the 3rd accused i.e. D.W.3 made on 17398, 20398, 24398 and 7598 were admitted in evidence as Exhibits G, L, M and N followed the ruling of this Court on 15th October, 1999 in a trial within trial by which the objection of counsel to the admission of the statement made 17th March, 1998 was over ruled. I am bound by that ruling.”  I cannot but observe that it is not very clear to me, whether what the Lower Court in the portion of its judgment reproduced above, was saying is that all the other statements made by the Appellant including the one he made on 1731998, were admitted after a trial within trial was conducted to determine their admissibility respectively; or whether what the said Court was saying, was that it admitted all the other statements made by the Appellant, as it was bound by its ruling made in respect of the statement of the Appellant on 15101999, in relation to the one made on 1731998, and which was admitted in evidence and marked as Exhibit “G”, on 15101999. I however have not seen any ruling of the Lower Court delivered on 15101999, in the records of appeal. The originals of the Exhibits in this case being also untraceable by the Exhibit Keeper of this Court, there is nothing by which I can solve the puzzle I have identified. Happily, the Appellant who has raised the issue of non est factum has not tied his submissions thereon to Exhibit “G”, i.e. the first statement which he made to the Police on 1731998, and in respect of which a trial within trial was conducted. Indeed, the Appellant relied on the said Exhibit on page 7 of his amended brief of argument to his own advantage by relying on it as his statement in which he gave the Police his alibi.  Also having regard to the notes of proceedings on pages 110-111, of the records of appeal, it becomes undisputable that it was the three statements of the Appellant recorded by PW6, an IPO in the case from State CID, Anti Robbery Section Owerri, that were admitted as Exhibits “L” “M” and “N”. See pages 105 and 110-111 of the records of appeal. I am of the considered opinion or view, that this would appear to be the only reason why the Appellant being conscious of the fact that he cannot properly rely on the principle of non est factum in respect of his statement that was admitted in evidence and marked as Exhibit “G” after a trial within trial, that he related his submissions on the said principle to Exhibits “L”“M” and “N”.  However, I cannot but say that the principle of non est factum would appear not to avail the Appellant in the instant case given the illuminating manner in which the Supreme Court enunciated the principle in the case of AIGUOREGHIAN v. THE STATE 2004 3 MJSC 71, relied on by the Appellant. It was stated thus: - Be it noted that it is trite that when a document is sought to be tendered and is objected to by counsel, what counsel objecting does at that stage is no more than a submission on the admissibility of the statement. Thus, as the issue of non-est factum is a matter of fact, the challenge of such a statement is more properly done when the accused or any other witness of his impugns the statement as not being that of the accused from the witness box. I agree with learned counsel for 2nd Appellant therefore that as counsel is not competent to give evidence from the bar and the challenge of a confessional statement on grounds of non-est factum is a matter of fact, the challenge is appropriately made when the accused as witness denies the making of such a statement.  As I had cause to observe in Nwangbomu v. State 1994 2 NWLR Pt. 327 380, a case identical to the one in hand: \"...Now the voluntary statement of the Appellant which was confessional in nature was received in the proceedings giving rise to this appeal as Exhibits B and B1 and these are part of the prosecution’s case. See Anofi Opayemi v. The State 1985 2 NWLR Pt. 5 101. The Appellant for his defence in rendering his testimony in Court, admitted he never said what was recorded. He thereby sought to retract the statement rather than its involuntariness that was in issue. In view of the appropriate attack of the Appellants of the statement Exhibits “A” and C as not being their deeds, it was incumbent on the Courts below to have made a finding on whether the said statements were actually made by the Appellants before holding that the statements were retracted or before putting them into any use in convicting the Appellants. It is noteworthy to stress that the terms \"retraction\" \"resile from\" have been used interchangeably in most decisions with the pleas of non-est factum. This is misleading since a statement must first be shown to have been made before it can be said to have been retracted by its maker for where the very making of the statement is in issue, the retraction cannot arise at that stage. It is in this wise that I agree that where an accused person sets up a defence of non-est factum in relation to a confessional statement what he has done is not a retraction but a denial of the making of the statement. No finding was made by the two Courts below on the issue of fact as to whether the Appellants made the statements. The application therefore of the rule in Oladejo v. The State 1987 3 NWLR Pt. 61 419 and Asanya v. The State 1991 3 NWLR Pt. 480 422, two cases that have been overruled, was therefore prejudicial to the Appellants whose conviction ought not to be allowed to stand. See Egboghonome v. The State 1993 7 NWLR Pt. 306 383. What it boils down to is that had the testimony of the 2nd Appellant and his extra-judicial statement Exhibit C not been treated as unreliable, the 2nd Appellant would have been absolved of the offence of murder of the deceased based on his defence of alibi which was not investigated. Furthermore, the evidence of PW2 who himself was a victim of the same attack, ought not to have been viewed with as much confidence as the Trial Court below did, it being the evidence of a victim.”  I have expressed the view that the principle of non est factum cannot avail the Appellant when under examination in chief he stated on page 170 of the record thus: - “I deny the offence as alleged. Following my arrest and charge, I made a total of 4 statements on 17.0398, 200398, 240398 and 070598. I do not rely on them as part of my defence because they were not voluntarily made. The fact is as ff sic”  Similarly, under cross-examination, he stated on page 189 of the records of appeal thus: - “It is true that I allegedly made four statements to the Police but I denied them as I made them under duress. In my statements, I started sic how I was arrested but what was recorded was not what I said in full. I emphasized that I made the statements under torture. It wasn’t all I stated that were recorded. That was why I petitioned the inspector General against the Police.” See many other pages of the records of appeal after this i.e. page 189, wherein the Appellant disclosed his reason for “disowning” his statements admitted as confessional statements.  It is in my considered view, obvious from what was stated above, that the reliance by the Appellant on the principle of non est factum, in respect of his statements recorded by PW6 and which statements  he did not oppose at the point of their being tendered, but only to disclose in his evidence that he did so, because he did not consider the said statements as having been voluntarily made, shows that the strategy adopted by the Appellant, is one that has now gone bad. I have before now referred to the pages of the records of appeal, containing the statements made by the Appellant to the Police. It is obvious therefrom, that in each of the statements the Appellant disclosed himself as being privy to the robbery in question; at least as one of the planners and also as having acted as a pointer. The statements made by the Appellant, therefore were rightly found by the Lower Court to be confessional statements and upon which the lower Court could have rightly acted; and indeed, rightly acted upon by the said Court in convicting the Appellant for the offence of armed robbery with which he was charged. This is more so, in the light of the evidence of PW4 as to how the Appellant came to be apprehended and which the lower Court believed, and which I cannot find any basis for faulting the same. This is more so as a trial Judge is the sole determinant of facts and law at the trial stage. See the old case of ABDULLAHI v. THE STATE  1985 LPELR-29SC, 1985 NWLR Pt. 3 523, wherein the Supreme Court stated thus: - \"It has been established by several authorities that a Court of Appeal must approach the findings of fact of a Trial Court with extreme caution. This is because a Court of Appeal has not had the advantage which the trial judge has enjoyed of seeing the witnesses and watching their demeanour. A Court of Appeal would only disturb the findings of fact of a trial Court where it is satisfied that the trial Court has made no use of such an advantage. If the trial judge has evaluated the evidence before him, it is not for the Court of Appeal to re-evaluate the same evidence and come to its own decision.” Indeed, I cannot but say that it is clear from the judgment of the Lower Court that it never found corroboration for the statement of the Appellant in the statement of the deceased suspect - Anoke. The Lower Court only commented to the effect that the confessional statements of the Appellant corroborated that of the said deceased suspect. I am of the considered view that there is a world of difference, in the two situations. Suffice it to say that as the Lower Court in its judgment relied on many facts apart from the alleged corroboration it was wrongly said to have found for the statements of the Appellant in the statement of the deceased Anoke, rendering the confessional statements of the Appellant to be probable, its reliance on the same, is eminently correct. Flowing from all that has been said before now, is that I cannot but find the lower Court to be correct in accepting and treating the statements of the Appellant as confessional statements and in relying on them in convicting the Appellant.  This is more so as the Appellant did not introduce any reasonable doubt into the prima facie case established against him, by the evidence adduced by the prosecution.  The question as to whether an accused person has introduced reasonable doubt in a criminal charge as established against him by the evidence led by the prosecution, is always a fact for resolution in a criminal trial. This, being the position, there is no dearth of authorities in respect of terms like “beyond reasonable doubt” and “reasonable doubt”. One of the cases in which the meaning of the terms was considered is the old case of BAKARE v.THE STATE 1987 3 S.C 1. Therein, the Supreme Court dwelling on “proof beyond reasonable doubt” vis-a-vis “reasonable doubt” stated thus: - “In his Brief, which was too brief to be of much use, learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that \"there is only one issue for determination in this appeal; viz \"whether or not the prosecution had proved its case beyond every reasonable doubt\". From the particulars of errormisdirection supporting this ground of appeal which were further elaborated in the Brief, it is obvious that there is here a thorough misconception of the requirement that the prosecution should prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Proof beyond reasonable doubt stems out of the compelling presumption of innocence inherent in our adversary system of criminal justice. To displace this presumption, the evidence of the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt, not beyond the shadow of any doubt that the person accused is guilty of the offence charged. Absolute certainty is impossible in any human adventure including the administration of criminal justice. Proof beyond reasonable doubt means just what it says. It does not admit of plausible and fanciful possibilities but it does admit of a high degree of cogency, consistent with an equally high degree of probability. As Denning, J. as he then was observed in Miller v. Minister of Pensions 1947 2 All. E.R. 373:- \"The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence - of course it is possible but not in the least probable, the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt\" ... Also it has to be noted that there is no burden on the prosecution to prove its case beyond all doubt. No. The burden is to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt with emphasis on reasonableness. Not all doubts are reasonable. Reasonable doubt will automatically exclude unreasonable doubt, fanciful doubt, imaginary doubt and speculative doubt - a doubt not borne out by the facts and surrounding circumstances of the case.  Another sense in which the expression \"Proof beyond Reasonable Doubt\" is used refers to the shifting of the onus of proof as stipulated by Section 1371 Evidence Act Cap 62 of 1958: - \"1371 If the commission of a crime by a party to any proceedings is directly in issue... it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.\" But if the prosecution proves the commission of a crime beyond reasonable doubt then the burden of proving reasonable doubt is shifted onto the accused - see Section 1373 of Cap 62 of 1958. What does this subsection mean in relation to the case now on appeal? It means this. At the close of the prosecution case the Court had heard 9 witnesses testified. If the prosecution witnesses were believed and there was nothing urged in defence, no fair 'minded jury can return any verdict except that of guilty. In other words the prosecution established this case beyond reasonable doubt. The onus then shifted to the defence to adduce evidence capable of creating some reasonable doubt in the mind of the trial Judge. The primary onus of establishing the guilt of the Appellant was still on the prosecution and this does [not] and did not shift. What does shift is the secondary onus or the onus of adducing some evidence which may render the prosecution case improbable and therefore unlikely to be true and thereby create a reasonable doubt:- R. v. Harry Lazarus Lobell 1957 41 C.R. App. R. 100 at p.104 per Goddard L.C.J... “Evidence that is not accepted cannot possibly create a doubt in the mind of a fair minded jury. If the defence account of the incident is disbelieved then that is the end of the story and there will then be no evidence on which to consider the existence of a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal was right in holding that the case was proved beyond reasonable doubt...” See also the cases of UCHE v. THE STATE 2015 LPELR-24693SC and ANKPEGHER v. STATE 2018 LPELR-43906SC, and many others which decide nothing different from what the same Court did on the issue of “proof beyond reasonable doubt” and “reasonable doubt” in the Bakare case supra.  Having read and highlighted the submissions of the parties in this appeal, it is obvious that the reasonable doubt the Appellant sought to introduce into the case of the prosecution, is that he could not have been arrested in connection with the robbery in respect of which he was charged, because he was not within or at the area or scene of the robbery incident of 1731998 as he was somewhere else and whereat he was arrested. That in the circumstances he could not be rightly found to be one of the robbers that escaped into the bush shortly after the robbery in question. Undoubtedly, this is a defence of alibi. I do not believe that the consideration of this defence requires a re-statement of the position of the law in respect of the meaning of alibi and all its nitty-gritty. I however consider it pertinent to say that it is settled in law, that non-investigation of alibi where it was given to the Police at the earliest opportunity by the accused person, cannot ipso facto result in the finding of such alibi as established or to have a destructive effect on the case of the prosecution. This in my considered view was the position of the Supreme Court in the old case of HAUSA V THE STATE 1994 6 NWLR Pt. 350 281 wherein it was said: - “It appears to me that none of these issues called for wholesale re-evaluation of the evidence adduced at the trial of the Appellant. Although the defence of alibi was not investigated by the police it is clear from the testimonies of P.W.2 and P.W.3 that the Appellant was seen and identified as the assailant of the deceased. ... As both P.W.2 and P.W.3 were believed by the learned trial Judge, the defence of alibi set up by the Appellant becomes untenable, even though the police failed to investigate it. The absence of the investigation is not in the circumstances of this case fatal to the case of the prosecution …“   In the case of Ntam v. State 1968 NMLR 86, which is similar to the present case, Brett, J.S.C. stated as follows: “There are occasions on which a failure to check an alibi may cause doubt on the reliability of the case for the prosecution, but in a case such as this in here the appellants were identified by three eyewitnesses there was a straight issue of credibility and we are notable to say that the Judge’s findings of fact were unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.”  Moreover, in Njovens & Ors. v. State, 1973 5 S.C. 17, Coker J.S.C. made the following observation at p. 65 thereof: “There is nothing extraordinary or esoteric in a plea of alibi. Such a plea postulates that the accused person could have been at a scene of the crime and only inferentially that he was not there. Even if it is the duty of the prosecution to check on a statement of alibi by an accused person and disprove the alibi or attempt to do so, there is no inflexible andor invariable way of doing this of the prosecution adduced sufficient and accepted evidence to fix the person at the scene of the crime at the material time. Surely, his alibi is thereby logically and physically demolished.” emphasis mine.  Therefore, these authorities clearly established that the failure to investigate the defence of alibi set up by the Appellant in the present case is not fatal to the case for the prosecution since the testimonies of P.W.2 and P.W.3 who were eyewitnesses had been accepted and believed by the learned trial Judge...”  I know of no decided case that has put on ground the principle that the non-investigation of alibi supplied by an accused person as a suspect to the Police by the Police to whom it is given, without more renders the case of the prosecution unreliable.  The Appellant in any case, testified in respect of his alibi. The question therefore is, whether the Appellant by the evidence he adduced before the lower Court established his alibi which by law he is required to do on a balance of probability and not beyond reasonable doubt. It is to be noted that the Lower Court in evaluating the evidence in the instant case in relation to the alibi of the Appellant observed to the effect that persons with whom the Appellant claimed to be with, shortly before the time of his arrest or those that were with him prior to his arrest, were not called by him as witnesses. I am of the considered view that a defence of alibi except where it is that a person was alone by himself and never interacted with any known or identifiable person, cannot be said to be proved on the mere ipse dixit of the person setting up the defence. It is my considered view, that common sense in fact dictates that a person who claimed to be with other persons at a different location from where a crime he is charged with is alleged to have happened, owes himself the duty to call if not all the persons he claimed to have been with, he should at least call one of them. The Appellant would appear to believe that whatever he says in Court must be accepted as gospel truth. Likewise, the Appellant would appear to believe that the fact that the 1st accused person testified that he Appellant was not a member of his gang sufficiently proved his alibi. He is wrong. The Appellant in my considered view never gave any worthwhile evidence in support of his alibi and it would surely have been a case of a perverse finding, if the lower Court found the Appellant to have established his alibi given the evidence of PW4 on pages 71-75 of the records of appeal. At pages 72-73, the witness is recorded as having testified thus: - “... While there, I saw the 1st accused running. I pursued him and caught him and dispossessed him of a pistol he was holding. I gave him a matchet cut on the right leg when he attempted to shoot me with the pistol. The pistol I recovered from him is stainless white. I handed over the pistol and the 1st accused to the Police. When I caught him he informed me there was another left in the bush. He also gave me the call sign of “Oyi” “Oyi” and that once I so shouted, he would think that it was he that I called. That was their call sign. On entry into the bush I called as was directed and the 3rd accused replied. When he saw me and realised that I was not his member he took to his heels. I then pursued and caught him. When I came back with him to the scene where the vehicle fell down we lifted the vehicle and found one double barrel gun. ... I went to the Police Station. It was there that I handed over the 3rd accused. That was at Orlu Police Station.”  Against the backdrop of all that has been said in relation to alibi, I am of the considered view that it becomes apparent that given the evidence of PW4, which the lower Court believed and which I cannot but observe was not challenged with any measure of success, that whatever alibi the Appellant set up in his statements, particularly the first of the statements, which he heavily relied on in the instant appeal, must crumble. The Appellant therefore, cannot be said to have introduced any reasonable doubt into the case of the prosecution by his evidence regarding his alibi which the lower Court did not believe and indeed, could not have believed given its Lower Court acceptance of the evidence of PW4.  Flowing from all that has been said is that the three issues formulated for the determination of the instant appeal by the Appellant are resolved against him; while the two issues formulated by the Respondent are resolved in its favour.  In the final analysis, the instant appeal fails and must be dismissed and is hereby dismissed. The prosecution in my considered view clearly proved its case against the Appellants beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the judgment delivered by the Lower Court, convicting the Appellant of the offence of armed robbery and sentencing him to death therefore, is affirmed.   ITA GEORGE MBABA, J.C.A.:  I agree with the reasoning and conclusions of my learned brother, A.O. Lokulo-Sodipe JCA, in the lead judgment, that this Appeal lacks merit. I too dismiss it.   IBRAHIM ALI ANDENYANGTSO, J.C.A.:  I have the privilege of reading in draft the judgment just delivered by my Noble Lord A. O Lokulo-Sodipe, JCA. I agree with his reasoning and conclusion that this appeal lacks merit. The facts of the case, and arguments of Counsel on both sides, have been succinctly captured in the lead judgment. I can only emphasize that the Appellant has made a mountain of the plea of alibi, which in law has certain requirements to be satisfied before the Court in order for the Appellant to reap the benefit thereof. The Appellant by law is expected to provide enough particulars, and this, very timeously, for the Police to investigate. Where the Appellant made a blanket statement that he was not at the scene of crime without more, he cannot have the benefit of that defence enured to him.  In the instant case, the Appellant alleged that he was in Lafia in Nasarawa State at the time of commission of the crime.  This, the trial Judge found incredible and disbelieved same. It is not the law that once a defence of an alibi is set up, then it becomes sacrosanct and must of necessity absolve the Appellant of culpability in a criminal trial. It has been held by the Supreme Court in the case of NJOVENS & ORS VS. STATE 1975 5 S.C 17 PER COKER J.S.C AT PAGE 65 that: “There is nothing extraordinary or esoteric in a plea of alibi. Such a plea postulates that the accused person could have been at the scene of the crime and only inferentially that he was not there. Even if it is the duty of the prosecution to check on a statement of alibi by an accused person and disprove the alibi or attempt to do so, there is no inflexible andor invariable way of doing this if the prosecution adduced sufficient and accepted evidence to fix the person at the scene of the crime at the material time.”  In other word, the word “ALIBI” is not a magic wand.  In the instant case, the evidence as found and accepted by the trial Court is overwhelming. See the evidence of PW4 at pages 71 -75 of the Record of Appeal.  Based on the above and fuller reasons advanced by my Noble Lord Lokulo-Sodipe JCA, I find no merit in this appeal and same is hereby dismissed. The judgment of the trial Court is hereby affirmed by me.-end!" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary " FACTS The appeal is against the judgment delivered on 20/6/2005, by the High Court of Justice, Owerri Judicial Division where the Appellant was the 3rd accused person in Charge No. HOW/ART/21/99. The Appellant along with three others were charged with the offence of armed robbery contrary to Section 1(2)(a) of the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Act, Cap. 398, Laws of Federation of Nigeria, 1990. They were alleged to have robbed one John Nwokeocha and his passengers of one Mercedes Benz 911 Lorry and money totaling N260,715.00, on 17/3/1998 at Mgbee along OrluUrualla-Akaokwa Road in Orlu Judicial Division. They were arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the charges read. The prosecution called 6 witnesses in the proof of its case while the Appellant and each of the other accused persons, testified on their own behalf, and called no other witness. In its judgment, the Lower Court noted that the 1st accused person in the charge before it, namely John Okorie confessed to the crime and that the other accused persons (Appellant inclusive) in their evidence denied the charge. The Lower Court, after an extensive review and evaluation of the evidence placed before it found the prosecution to have proved its case against the Appellant and 2 of the other accused persons beyond reasonable doubt and duly sentenced each of them to death. (The 4th accused person in the charge, having been found not guilty, was acquitted and discharged.) It is from that conviction and sentence that this appeal was brought to the Court of Appeal.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI, J.S.C. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  The Appellant as Plaintiff at the trial Court is the 1st son of late Oji Anya who died in Enugu on 1662004 while the original 1st Respondent was the mother of the Appellant with others, who was the surviving wife of the said late Oji Anya but she died during the pendency of the appeal at the lower Court. After the death of late Oji Anya, his family had several meetings to distribute his estate among them since it was believed that he died intestate. After commencing the process of obtaining Letters of Administration from the Probate Registry of the High Court, Umuahia, problem ensued as to the entitlement of the parties to the said estate and whether the female children of the family should receive any portion. This caused the extended family to intervene and resolved that an equitable formula for the distribution be adopted. The original 1st Respondent now deceased rejected the resolution and alleged that the deceased left a Will prepared by one Clement H. C. Nwanya, Esq., appointing her and Mr. Nwanya as Executors of the 2 buildings forming part of the estate as Exhibit A. The will was doubted by the Appellant Plaintiff which caused him to file the suit against the Respondents at the trial Court as follows: a. A declaration that the plaintiff's father late Chief Oji Uke Anya who died on the 16th day of June, 2004 at Enugu, Enugu State died intestate. b. A declaration that the document dated the 26th day of October 1998 purportedly deposited at the probate registry Enugu purporting to be the will and last testament of Chief Oji Uke Anya is void and of no effect whatsoever. c. A declaration that the estate of Chief Oji Uke Anya is to be distributed in accordance with the land and custom of inheritance of Igbere people of Abia State of Nigeria. d. A perpetual injunction restraining the defendants from acting or purporting to act as Executors of the said purported will and last testament of Chief Oji Uke Anya or in any way or manner tempering with or dealing in the assets of the estate of late Chief Oji Uke Anya wherever found or situate. e. An order directing the defendant to render an account unto the plaintiff of all monies collected by them as rent from 2 buildings in the estate of late Chief Oji Uke Anya respectively situate at No. 35 Zik Avenue and No. 25 Ibiam Street all in Uwani Enugu State.  The Respondents counter-claimed and defended it wherein the trial Court's judgment favoured the Respondents, same affirmed by the lower Court, hence this appeal.   To argue the appeal, the Appellant formulated 3 issues for the determination of the appeal thus: 1. Was the Court of Appeal right to set aside the findings of facts by the High Court against which there was no appeal? 2.From the unchallenged findings of fact by the High Court, was the Court of Appeal right when it found that failure to attach weight to Exhibit T did not affect the conclusion reached by the High Court? 3. Was the Court of Appeal right to suo motu raise and resolve the issue of purported allegation of forgery without affording the parties an opportunity to address on it?  The 3 issues formulated and responded to by the Respondents shall be considered together.  It is the contention of the Appellant that the lower Court set aside the findings of the trial Court which were not appealed against by the Respondents. He submitted that the raising of the issue of forgery as a fresh point by the lower Court without affording the parties the opportunity to address it was perverse, having resolved same against the Appellant that since there was no cross appeal or Respondents' notice, the lower Court was wrong to set aside the findings of facts by the High Court. He on Exhibit T concluded that it was wrong for the lower Court to hold in one breath that Exhibit T being admissible did not affect the conclusion reached by the High Court. His submission is that Exhibit T by its circumstances and Section 26 of the Evidence Act is inadmissible in evidence. He also cited in support FAWEHINMI v. NBA NO.2 1989 2 NWLR PT.105 AT 622-623.  Furthermore, he submitted that the lower Court having raised the issue of forgery suo motu and did not give the parties the opportunity to address it violated the right to fair hearing of the Appellant. He relied on AMALE v. SOKOTO LG 2012 5 NWLR PT. 1292 202.  The Respondents argued that the lower Court was right to set aside the findings of facts by the trial Court even though there was no appeal against it since the decision was right though the reasons may not be right. He relied on L.T.P.P. LTD v. UBN PLC 2007 1 WRL 117. They submitted that the Respondents did not appeal by cross appeal or Respondents' Notice since they were comfortable with the decision reached in their favour.  On Exhibit T, it was contended that being an aborted Terms of Settlement, no value ought to be attached to it since by the independent evidence, the case was in favour of the 1st Respondent. On the issue of forgery raised by the lower Court suo motu, it was argued that it was there before the trial Court where a handwriting expert testified as PW2 and in favour of the 1st Respondent. Thus, the issue of forgery was not raised for the first time on appeal suo motu by the lower Court. The Appellant was given fair hearing on it but failed.  On the dismissal of the case of the Appellant by the lower Court, the question is not whether there was an appeal on it or not, but based on the proof of the counterclaim of the Respondents which the lower Court upheld. Every civil case is determined by balance of probability on the scale of justice. The case herein is between the weight of Exhibit T and the Will. To rehearse the facts again, after the death of late Oji Anya, his family had several meetings to distribute his estate among them since it was believed that he died intestate. After commencing the process of obtaining Letters of Administration from the Probate Registry of the High Court, Umuahia, problem ensued as to the entitlement of the parties to the said estate and whether the female children of the family should receive any portion. This caused the extended family to intervene and resolved that an equitable formula for the distribution be adopted Exhibit T. The original 1st Respondent now deceased rejected the resolution and alleged that the deceased left a Will prepared by one Clement H. C. Nwanya, Esq, appointing her and Mr. Nwanya as Executors of the 2 buildings forming part of the estate as Exhibit A. The lower Court considered that based on the evidence, it was proved that the Will left by the deceased was valid and hence to be honoured as the last testament of the deceased.  The Respondents produced the Will of the deceased albeit the resolution of Exhibit T, which the lower Court compared to dismiss the case of the Appellant. The Will therefore supervened and knocked down the case of the Appellant. The validity of the Will was tested and proved to have been made by the deceased against Exhibit T. This was the reason the lower Court affirmed the case of the Respondents against that of the Appellant on the authority of ADEBAJO & 7 ORS v. ADEBAJO & 7 ORS 1973 3 ECSLR 544. The validity of a Will under Section 4 of the Wills Law of Lagos State came up for interpretation, wherein Per ONNOGHEN, JSC in DAWODU v. ISIKALU & ORS 2019 LPELR-46435SC, expounded the matter especially on the genuineness of a Will and proving same.  “By the provisions of Section 1 of the Wills Law of Lagos State: \"It shall be lawful for every person to bequeath or dispose by his will executed in accordance with the provisions of this law, all property by which he is entitled to either in law or equity, or at the time of his death.\" This means that a person who desires to make a Will must satisfy the requirements of law for the Will to be valid, else it will be invalid. The burden, however, for the proof of validity of a document will, the genuineness or authenticity thereof lies on the person propounding it and once this is satisfied, the burden is cast upon those attacking it.  In the instant case, the respondents have made a claim in respect of their entitlements pertaining to the property on the ground that it is family property - the subject matter covered by Exhibit TD1. Appellant denied the entitlement and asserted that there was no such entitlement, as there was a Will which had bequeathed the said property to her mother solely and with her mother's death, she was now a sole beneficiary. It is therefore a case of communal family ownership against personalindividual ownership of property. Respondents therefore denied the validity of the Will, Exhibit TD1, while appellant said it was valid. It is trite law that for a will or testamentary intention of a deceased person which ought to be respected, to be given effect to, there must be absolute compliance with the requirements of the Wills law. The provisions of the Wills Law, as in all laws, where they are clear and unambiguous, must be given their ordinary and literal meaning... Now, Exhibit TD1 under consideration fell short of the mandatory minimum of two 2 required subscribing witnesses as required by Section 4 1 of the Wills Law Cap 194 Laws of Lagos State 2003.”  Unlike the above case, where the Will was held invalid for not meeting up with the requirements of the Law, the instant case proved and as confirmed by the lower Court that the Will of the deceased, Exhibit A, met all the requirements of a valid Will to be sustained and granted. In fact, the requirements of 2 witnesses who witnessed the deceased, Chief O.U. Anya, appending his signature to the Will and they thereafter signed and put their names therein was abundantly proved.  It was further proved on the weight between Exhibit A and Exhibit T that the Will satisfied all the formal requirements of a valid Will; that there was cogent evidence that the testator, Chief O.U. Anya, had the mental and educational capacity to make a Will. There was also evidence that the deceased had no disability with his eyes and that 2 persons Legal Practitioners witnessed him append his signature to the Will before they subscribed to same. This therefore has proved the validity and superiority of Exhibit A over Exhibit T that no weight should in fact be attached to Exhibit T at all having been knocked down by Exhibit A.  The lower Court was therefore right to dismiss the Appellant's case.  Another gravamen of the Appellant is that the lower Court raised the issue of forgery suo motu without affording the parties the opportunity to address it. The law is well entrenched further that the Appeal Court has the discretion to take on a point suo motu and the general principle is that the parties must be given an opportunity to be heard. However, authorities have shown that the failure to observe this principle would result into a misdirection which will be over-turned only if there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. Per OGUNBIYI, JSC in DICKSON OGUNSEINDE VIRYA FARMS LTD v. SOCIETE GENERALE BANK LTD & ORS 2018 LPELR- 43710SC.  The facts in this case do not show that this was the case. The Appellant's case before the trial Court was founded on the fact that the Will left by the deceased was forged wherein in proof or otherwise, a handwriting expert testified, which was in favour of the Respondents. How then did the issue of forgery become fresh on appeal? The lower Court being confronted with the whole facts and as reflected in the record, discovered that the issue of forgery was well founded and cannot be a new issue calling for address of parties. I think the Appellant is lost as to the distinction between raising an issue suo motu and looking into the casefile by the Court to determine a matter. This was touched by Per OKORO, JSC in AKEREDOLU v. ABRAHAM & ORS 2018 LPELR-44067SC, when he inter alia proposed that: I agree with the Court below that the fact of the appellant carrying on part of his law business in Abuja was not introduced into the litigation by the learned trial Judge. Rather, it was exposed to the Court by the learned Senior counsel for the Appellant via a letter to the Deputy Chief Registrar of the Court where one of the offices of the Appellant's Law office is shown to be located in Abuja. A distinction must be drawn between a Court raising an issue suo motu and looking into its records to resolve the issue, and the Court looking into its records suo motu to resolve an issue raised by the parties. In respect of the former, a Court raising an issue suo motu, must invite the parties to address it before using the issue in the judgment. But on the latter situation where the Court looks into the record of appeal to enable it resolve issues already raised by the parties, a Court is not bound to invite the parties to address it. A Court can only be accused of raising an issue, matter or fact suo motu if the issue, matter or fact did not exist in the litigation. A Court cannot be accused of raising an issue, matter or fact suo motu if the issue, matter or fact exists in the litigation. A Judge, by the nature of his adjudicatory functions, can draw inferences from stated facts in a case and by such inferences; the Judge can arrive at conclusions. It will be wrong to say that inferences legitimately drawn from facts in the case are introduced suo motu. That is not correct.  This is nothing but a foul cry as the records do not demonstrate it. Besides, where is the injustice wrought against the Appellant? The case of the Appellant is far from what he is asserting.  The appeal of the Appellant is most unmeritorious and must be dismissed and is hereby dismissed. The concurrent judgments of the 2 Courts is affirmed. I award costs of N200,000.00 against the Appellant.   OLUKAYODE ARIWOOLA, J.S.C.: I had the opportunity of reading in draft the lead judgment of my learned brother, Abba Aji, J.S.C. just delivered. I am in agreement with the reasoning therein and conclusion arrived thereat, that the appeal lacks merit and should be dismissed. I too will dismiss the appeal.  I abide by the consequential orders including that on costs. Appeal dismissed.   MUSA DATTIJO MUHAMMAD, J.S.C.:  I read in advance the lead judgment of my learned brother UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI J.S.C. just delivered. I entirely agree with the reasoning and conclusion therein that the appeal has no merit. I imbibe the reasoning in the lead judgment as mine in dismissing the appeal and abide by the consequential orders outlined in the lead judgment.   AMINA ADAMU AUGIE, J.S.C.:  My learned brother, ABBA-AJI, J.S.C., who just delivered the lead Judgment, dealt extensively with the Issues canvassed by the Parties, and I agree entirely with his reasoning and conclusion, which represents my views on all the issues.  In the circumstances, I also dismiss this Appeal, which totally lacks merit, and I also abide by all the consequential Orders he made in the lead Judgment.   PAUL ADAMU GALUMJE, J.S.C.:  I have had the privilege of reading in draft, the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI, J.S.C and I agree with the reasons leading to the conclusion that the appeal is bereft of merit and should be dismissed. Accordingly, I join my brother in dismissing it. The concurrent findings of the two 2 lower Courts are affirmed. I endorse the consequential order made as to costs.-end!" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The Appellant/Plaintiff was the 1st son of late Oji Anya. The original 1st Respondent, was his mother (as well as those of the other parties) as well as the surviving wife of the said late Oji Anya (but she died during the pendency of the appeal at the Court of Appeal).  After the death of late Oji Anya, his immediate family believing he died intestate, held several meetings to distribute his estate among them. However, after commencing the process of obtaining Letters of Administration from the Probate Registry of the High Court, Umuahia, problem ensued as to the entitlement of the parties to the said estate and whether the female children of the family should receive any portion. The extended family intervened and it was resolved that an equitable formula for the distribution be adopted. Thereupon, the original 1st Respondent (now deceased wife/mother) rejected the resolution and alleged that the deceased left a Will prepared by one Clement H. C. Nwanya, Esq., appointing her and Mr. Nwanya as Executors of  two (2) buildings forming part of the estate.  The Appellant/Plaintiff therefore brought a suit seeking, among others -  1. A declaration that the late Chief Oji Uke Anya died intestate; and that the document purporting to be the will and the last testament of Chief Oji Uke Anya is void and of no effect whatsoever. 2. A declaration that the estate of Chief Oji Uke Anya is to be distributed in accordance with the custom of inheritance of Igbere people of Abia State of Nigeria. d. A perpetual injunction restraining the defendants from acting or purporting to act as Executors of the said purported will and last testament of Chief Oji Uke Anya; and an order directing the defendant to render an account unto the plaintiff of all monies collected by them as rent from 2 buildings in the estate located at Uwani Enugu State.  The Respondents counter-claimed and defended. The trial Court gave judgment in favour of the Respondents, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  MUDASHIRU NASIRU ONIYANGI, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  The 2nd Respondent herein was the Plaintiff before the High Court of Bauchi State sitting in Bauchi in a suit he instituted on the 6th of March, 2007 against the 1st and 2nd Appellants and the 1st Respondent. It was his contention that he was allocated shop No. 53, Wunti Shopping Complex Bauchi vide a letter of allocation issued by the 1st Respondent through its Chief executive dated 3rd February, 2005 The said letter was tendered and admitted as Exhibit LD 1. In the said letter, the 2nd Respondent was to pay a total sum of N600,000.00 to the 1st Respondent through Yankari Saving and Loan Limited. It is his case that he paid the said sum by two installments of N500,000.00 and N100,000.00 on the 21st day of February, 2005 and 29th December, 2005 respectively. Receipt for the payment were tendered and admitted in evidence as Exhibit LD 2 and LD 3. Consequent upon the foregoing payments, the Yankari Saving and Loan Limited issued to the 2nd Respondent a letter of confirmation of payment and which will authorize the 1st Respondent to release the keys of the said shop to the 2nd Respondent. The said letter was tendered and admitted as Exhibit LD 4. When the 2nd Respondent presented the letter exhibits LD 4 to the 1st Appellant, who was the Permanent Secretary in the 1st Respondent’s ministry, he was allegedly abused and insulted by the 1st Appellant Eng. Zabairu Yakubu. At that time, it was alleged that the 1st Appellant has allocated the shop to himself using the name of his son 2nd Respondent as crony. It is the case of the 2nd Respondent that as at that time 2005, the 1st & 2nd Appellants have not made any payment on the shop. It was on the 30th day of January, 2007 when the suit by the 2nd Respondent was pending that payment was made. It was also his contention that the Appellant did not tender any letter of allocation of the said shop but lately produced a certified letter of confirmation of payment dated 9th November, 2010 Exhibit Waziri 1  For the foregoing, the 2nd Respondent instituted his action at the lower Court claiming as follows in paragraph 19 of his statement of claim see page 6 of the Record of Appeal-  The Plaintiff whereof claims against the Defendants jointly and severally: a An Order of specific performance compelling the Defendants to deliver up possession or allow the Plaintiff access to the said shop No. 53 Wunti shopping complex, Bauchi being the original and rightful allotee of the said shop. b An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd Defendants from interfering with the plaintiff’s ownership and enjoyment of the said shop No. 53 Wunti shopping complex, Bauchi. c General damages of N500,000.00 d Cost of this action.  Issues were joined by parties. At the trial, the Respondent as Plaintiff testified and tendered 5 exhibits. On their behalf, the 1st and 2nd Appellants as 1st and 2nd Defendants called two witnesses in their defence and tendered Exhibit Waziri 1 and closed their case. The 1st Respondent as 3rd Defendant did not give any evidence but adopted the evidence of the 1st and 2nd Appellants. The learned trial judge in his wisdom entered judgment in favour of the Plaintiff 2nd Respondent in the following terms: See pages 127 - 128 of the Record of Appeal: “On the whole, the Plaintiff having proved his case by preponderance of evidence is entitled to judgment in favour of the plaintiffsic in the following terms: “a The Plaintiff having successfully established the claims against shop No.53 is entitled to possession of the shop and I hereby order the 2nd Defendant to deliver up possession of the shop No.53 Wunti shopping complex forthwith. The Plaintiff being the rightful allottee and having paid its full value. b I hereby order a perpetual injunction restraining the 1st & 2nd Defendants from intruding with the Plaintiff’s ownership of shop No. 53 and enjoyment thereof forthwith. c With the Plaintiff now having established in principle his legal entitlement, I hereby assend sic all order for the payment of general damages of the total sum of N150,000.00 only against the Defendants relying on MRS RONKE OMIYELE VS. MOBOLAJI MACAULEY & 4 ORS 2007 37 NSCQLR at Page 906. Ratio 6. d The cost of filing the matter and all fees paid for other processes as asked is awarded against the Defendants in the sum of N1,600.10 only payable to the Plaintiff”.  Let me quickly put on record here that the foregoing are reproduced verbatim.  Pained by the outcome of the trial, the Appellant initially filed the notice of Appeal dated 2nd April, 2013 containing a lone ground. Vide the order of this Court, an amended notice of Appeal filed on 3rd May, 2019 was deemed as properly filed and served on 7th day of May, 2019. It has four grounds. In paragraph 4 of the said amended Notice of Appeal, he sought for the following reliefs: 1 An Order setting aside the judgment of the High Court Bauchi State presided over by Hon. Justice M. A. Sambo in suit No. BA512007 delivered on the 22nd day of March, 2013 on ground of lack of jurisdiction. OR in the alternative 2 An Order setting aside the judgment of the High Court Bauchi State presided over by Hon Justice M. A. Sambo in suit No. BA512007 delivered on the 22nd day of March, 2013 and dismissed same for lacking in merit.  Upon the transmission of the Record of Appeal on the 28th day of March, 2014 and which was deemed as properly compiled and transmitted on the 23rd day of March, 2017, respective Counsel filed and exchanged their brief of argument.  The Appellant’s amended brief of argument filed on the 9th day of October 2019 was deemed as properly filed and served on the 7th day of May, 2019. Therein, the following issues are presented for the determination of the Appeal. 1 Whether from the fact and evidence, the trial Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the suit No. BA522007 filed by the 2nd Respondent as Plaintiff in the lower Court and against the Appellants as 1st and 2nd Defendants in the Lower Court. 2 Whether the trial Court was right to enter judgment in favour of the Plaintiff in respect of the relief not sought by him before it. 3 Whether in view of the evidence led, the trial Court was right to have entered judgment for the Plaintiff. 4 Whether it is the duty of Plaintiff to rely on the strength of his case and not on the weakness of the Defendant’s case? 5 Whether absence of the reference number and use of paper not being used by the 3rd Defendant in its custom and traditions in respect of Exhibits LD 1 makes it in law suspicious as to its originality and authenticity?  The 1st Respondent did not file any brief.  On behalf of the second Respondent, a brief of argument dated 21st day of April, 2017 was filed on the 24th day of April, 2017. The said brief was deemed as properly filed and served by this Court on the 7th day of May, 2019. However he was not in Court on the day of hearing despite being served with hearing notice. The said brief was treated as having being argued pursuant to Order 19 Rule 9 4 of the Court of Appeal Rules, 2016. In the said brief, the following lone issue was presented for the determination of the Appeal” “Whether the lower Court was not right when having made specific finding and properly evaluated the evidence on the record, he came to the conclusion that the 2nd Respondent was the rightful person to be entitled to the ownership of shop No. 53, Wunti Shopping Complex Bauchi State, regard being had to Exhibit LD 4, the letter of confirmation of allocation and final payments.\"  After a careful reading of the record of proceeding and the judgment of the trial Court and coupled with the Notice and ground of Appeal, I am of the view that adopting the issues raised by the Appellant for the determination of the Appeal would be apt in this circumstances hence, I adopt the issues formulated by the Appellant for the determination of this Appeal. Before then, I have noticed that the Respondent raised a Preliminary Objection somewhere in his unpaginated brief of argument deemed as properly filed on 7th May, 2019. It is on record that the Respondent was absent on the hearing day of this Appeal despite the service of hearing notice on him through his Counsel. Based on that, the Court invoked its powers under Order 19 Rule 94 and treated the Appeal as having being duly argued. That is to say that the Respondent was not available to pursue his contention as contained in the said notice of Preliminary Objection. On that note, the said notice of objection is deemed as abandoned and same be and is hereby struck out. Having said these, I will now proceed to consider the issues for determination presented by the Appellant. In doing this, I will take the first issue separately and take issues 2 - 5 together since they all tend to be challenging the appropriateness or other wise of or otherwise of the evaluation of the evidence, before the trial Court which led to the entering of judgment in favour of the Respondent.  In my view, that will also provide answers to the question whether or not Respondents case before the trial Court was weak or strong and whether Exhibit L D 1 was properly admitted in evidence.  ISSUE ONE Whether from the facts and evidence the Trial Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the suit NO. BA512007 filed by the 2nd Respondent as Plaintiff in the lower Court and against the Appellants as 1st and 2nd Defendant in the lower Court.  The contention of the Appellant on this issue is that from the fact and evidence before the trial Court, is that the Court has no requisite jurisdiction to adjudicate over the suit filed by the 2nd Respondent as Plaintiff at the trial Court against the Appellants as 1st and 2nd Defendants. It is his contention that the 1st Appellant as 1st Defendant before the Court, was the Permanent Secretary of Bauchi State Ministry of Housing, Environment and resident in Bauchi. The 1st Respondent was the 3rd Defendant before the trial Court is a Ministry of Bauchi State Government Government Agent being charged with the task of building maintenance, allocation and any other matter in relation to house and shops owned by Bauchi State Government. It also looks after the general safety of the public environment. Therefore both the 1st Appellant and 1st Respondent before this Court are public officers. Therefore the alleged act said to have been done by the 1st Appellant were done in his capacity as Permanent Secretary Ministry of Housing and Environment Bauchi State. He referred to the evidence of the Plaintiff as PW1 contained in pages 54 lines 19-34. He submitted that based on the foregoing, the 1st and 3rd Defendant before the trial Court are public officers and that the alleged act was done in their official capacity. He added that the cause of action arose in February, 2005 and the 2nd Respondent in this Court as Plaintiff at the trial Court filed his suit on 14th day of March, 2007. He argued that the suit was filed after a period of 2 years from the date when the cause of action arose. He submitted that the failure of 2nd Respondent to file his suit before the trial Court against the 1st and 3rd Defendants before the trial Court with the time limited by law robbed the lower Court of the requisite jurisdiction to adjudicate on the matter. He relied on Section 2a of the Public Officer Protection Act Cap. P41 Laws of Federation of Nigeria L.F.N 2004.  Based on the foregoing he urged the Court to resolve this issue in favour of the Appellants.  I have carefully read through the brief of argument by the Respondent. Nowhere did he offer any argument in response to issue number one of the Appellant. Therefore, the argument of the Appellant on this issue would be considered on its merit.  The single question that really come to mind having regard to the contention of the Appellant on this issue is whether or not the suit by the 2nd Respondent at the trial Court against the 1st Appellant and the 1st Respondent is statute barred. By virtue of Section 2a of the Public Officers Protection Act Cap. P41, LFN. 2004 which provided statutory limitation period prescribed 3 months within which an action can be instituted against a public officer. By this provision, where an action is brought against a public officer outside the time prescribed under that law, such proceedings should not be entertained by the Court because it is statute barred. See FORESTRY RESEARCH INST. OF NIGERIA v. GOLD 2007 11 NWLR Pt. 1044 1 and AGBEFAWO AREMU TAJUDEED v. CUSTOMS, IMMIGRATION AND PRISON SERVICE BOARD 2009 LPELR- 3655. Where an action is statute barred, a Plaintiff who might have had a cause of action loses the right to enforce the cause of action by judicial process because the period prescribed by the imitation law for instituting such an action has elapsed. See ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ADAMAWA STATE & ORS v. ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE FEDERATION 2014 LPELR - 23221, P.N. UDOH TRADING CO. LTD v. SUNDAY ABERE & ANOR 2001 LPELR- 2893. In order to determine whether or not an action is statute barred, the Court should confine itself to the averments in the Writ of Summons and the statement of claim which alleges the factual situation that gives rise to the cause of action. See UNION BANK OF NIGERIA v. ROMANUS C. UMEODUAGU 2004 13 NWLR Pt. 890 352.  In line with the decisions in the foregoing decided case which in the main saddled the Court with the responsibility of looking into the endorsement in the writ of summons and the statement of claim, I will proceed to examine the aforementioned processes. In the writ of summons by the 2nd Respondent before the trial Court, the following are the reliefs sought against the Defendants jointly and severally- A An order of specific performance compelling the Defendant to deliver up possession or allow the Plaintiff access to the said shop No. 53 Wunti Shopping Complex, Bauchi being the original and rightful allotee of the said shop. B An order of perpetual injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd Defendants from interfering with the Plaintiff’s ownership and enjoyment of the said shop No. 53 Wunti Shopping Complex, Bauchi. C General damages of N500,000.00 Five Hundred Thousand Naira Only D Cost of this action.  In the statement of claim by the Plaintiff 2nd Respondent, paragraphs 4-18 suggests to me that the 1st Respondent offered for sale to the general public in Bauchi State Shops built by Government at Wunti Shopping Complex Bauchi for N600,000.00. The 2nd Respondent applied and was allotted shop No. 53 at Wunti Shopping Complex. He paid an initial down payment of N500,000.00 and later the balance of N100,000.00. Having done this, he applied for delivery of the said shop after being issued with the certificate of completion of payment by the Yankari savings and loans Bauchi. This bid met a stone wall when the Permanent Secretary 1st Appellant refused and told him that the said shop was allocated to another person who was later discovered to be his son.  This situation motivated the 2nd Respondent to institute the action. In my humble view, the relationship between the 1st and 2nd Respondents is that of a contractual obligation of sale of landed property shop. There is that offer of the shop to the general public in Bauchi State and the acceptance by the said Respondent and payment of consideration which is the sum of N600,000.00. that clearly suggest no other thing than a contractual relationship of sale of a shop which is a landed property. The question now is whether the limitation law Section 2a of the Public Officer Protection Act applies to cases of contract. My response to this is in the negative. My view is buttress with the dictum in the case of OSUU S. C. ODUKO v. GOVT OF EBONYI STATE OF NIGERIA AND 3 ORS 2004 13 NWLR Pt. 891 pg. 487 at 493 where the Court said thus: “Section 2a of the Public Officer Protection Act which provides that an action, prosecution or proceeding shall not lie or be instituted against my person for an act done in pursuance of execution or intended execution of any act or law or of any pubic duty or authority or any alleged neglect or default thereof unless it is commenced within three months after the act, neglect or default complained of does not apply to cases of recovery of land, breach of contract, claim for work and labour done. In the instance case Section 2a of the Act cannot allow the 3rd Respondent’s action leading to the appeal because the Appellants claim was founded on contract. The trial Court was absolutely in error when it held that the Appellant action is statute barred. See SALAKO v. L.E.D.B. AND ANOR 1953 20 NLR 169, JUDICIAL SERVICE COMMISSION v. ALAKA 1982 8-10 CA 42, ALAPIKI v. GOVT OF RIVERS STATE 1991 8 NWLR P. 211 575.”  Considering the forgoing and the transaction between the Appellant, 1st and 2nd Respondents which is based on a contractual obligation of offer and acceptance of sale of shop No. 53 at Wunti Shopping Complex and the payment of the consideration, it is my candid view that the suit of the 2nd Respondent is not statute barred. The trial Court has the jurisdiction to entertain the suit. The Appellants cannot take refuge under the provision of S. 2a of the Public Officer Protection Act, Cap. P41 LFN. 2004. I accordingly so hold. Therefore I answer the question in the negative and resolve issue one against the Appellants.  ISSUES 2, 3, 4 & 5 The next question is whether the trial Court entered judgment in favour of the Plaintiff in respect of the relief not sought.  The contention of the Appellant is that the trial Court erred in entering judgment in favour of the Plaintiff in respect of relief not sought. It is his argument that the Respondent as Plaintiff only claimed the cost of the action simplicita but the Court in its judgment suo motu assessed and awarded cost of filing the suit. He added that there is no sufficient evidence before the Court to grant such award. He submitted that it is a long settled principle of law that Court does not grant the relief not sought. He relied on the case of KEREWE v. ABRAHAM 2010 1 NWLR PT. 1176 P. 443 at P. 450 R. 7, UDO ESEIN AKPAN AKPAKPAN V AKPAN AKPAKPAN 2010 1 NWLR PT. 1176 P. 627 at P. 628 to 629 R. 1.  On whether in view of the evidence led, the trial Court was right to have entered judgment for the Plaintiff. His contention is that from the evidence led, the Plaintiff 2nd Respondent is not entitled to an order of specific performance. His argument is that the 2nd Respondent evidence on page 54 lines 18-20 of the record of proceedings is that he got allocation letter, Exhibit LD1 on 3rd February, 2005 from the 1st Respondent and he made his first payment of N500,000.00 on 21st February, 2005 and paid the balance of N100,000.00 on 29th December, 2005 i.e. more than 10 months after instead of in 30 days as contained in the allocation letter Exhibit LD1. Therefore the 2nd Respondent neglected to comply with the condition of the allocation. He failed to make the complete payment within 30 days prescribed in Exhibit LD1. He added that he who seek equity must show that he is vigilant and does all what is required of him to clean hand to enforce it. He referred to the case of NLEWEDIM V UDUMA 1995 30 LRCN Pg. 113 at 115-116 R. 2 and 3 and 5, F.G.N. v. ZEBRA 2003 105 LRCN Pg. 363 at 369 R. 11. He submitted further that where contract is made subject to the fulfillment of certain specific terms and condition, the contract is not form and not binding unless and until those terms and conditions are complied with or fulfilled. He added that the contract is not formed because the conditions for the allocation are breached. Therefore, something cannot be put on nothing. He relied on the case of BEST NIG. LTD v. BLACKWOOD HODGE NIG. LTD SURPA 2011R. 7. He urged the Court to hold that the failure of the 2nd Respondent to comply with the terms of the contract as contained in Exhibit LD1 will negate his right to claim for specific performance of an order to take possession of the said shop.  On the contention that the 2nd Respondent relied on the weakness of the Appellants’ case, he argued that it is the duty of the Plaintiff to prove that he has done all that is required of him or that he has met and complied with all the condition enumerated in the letter of allocation. He referred to the following case EYO v. ONUOHA & ANOR 2011 VOL. 195 Pg. 38 at 45 R. 4, BAYOL v. AHEMBA 1999 71 LRCN Pg. 2347 at 2356 R. 9 and OKONKWO V OGBOGU 1996 5 NWLR PT. 449 PG. 420 at 422 R. 2.  He urged the Court to hold that the trial judge erred in law when he held that the 2nd Appellant made payment after 2 years nine months upon allocation and that the 2nd Appellant is guilty of the same wrong as the 2nd Respondent and cannot rely on same as shield.  Another complaint of the Appellant is that Exhibit LD1 bears no reference number and that it is contained in a different paper compared with what the 1st Respondent by tradition uses, he contended that the paper used for Exhibit LD1 raises some suspicion as to its originality and authenticity. He urged the Court to discountenance Exhibit LD1. He relied on the case of UDEH v. OKOLI 2009 7 NWLR PT. 1141 pg. 571 at 575 to 577 R. 4. In conclusion, he submitted that in view of the foregoing, the trial Court was wrong to have come to the conclusion that the 2nd Respondent Plaintiff proved his case by preponderance of evidence warranting him to judgment as specified on pages 127-128 of the record.  He urged the Court to allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the trial Court and dismiss the claim of the 2nd Respondent before the trial Court.  The reaction of the 2nd Respondent to the foregoing argument of the Appellants is that the decision of the lower Court is unassailable and that it is on a firma terra, regard being had to the pleadings of the parties and the evidence on record. He added that the trial Court took its time to properly evaluate the evidence on record before coming to specific finding and conclusion. He submitted that evaluation is the primary responsibility of a trial Court. He added that where the record of proceedings show that a trial Court assessed the evidence produced before it and accorded probative value to same before coming to a conclusion and making a finding of fact, the appellate Court will not interfere with the conclusion nor substitute its own view for that of the trial Court. He referred to the following cases AKINLOYE VS EYIYOLA 1968 NMLR 92 AT 93, AJIBULU V AJAYI 2014 2 NWLR PT. 1392 483, IKUMONIHAN V STATE 2014 2 NWLR PT. 1392 564 and MOGAJI v. ODOFIN 1978 4 SC 91. Further to these, he referred to page 119 lines 31-38 made findings on the merit of the case of the 2nd Respondent, pages 120-121, lines 35-37 on principle of estoppel that operate against the 2nd Appellant, pg. 121, lines 33-38 on the unreliability of the evidence of the Appellants, page 122, lines 15-21 on the unassailability of the 2nd Respondent’s case vis-a-vis Exhibits LD1 and LD4, page 124, lines 6-12 on the evidence of the witnesses of the Appellant which reinforced the case of the 2nd Respondent, page 124, lines 6-12 on the evidence of the Appellant that supports and reinforce the case of the 2nd Respondent and page 127, lines 19-29 on the competing rights of the 2nd Respondent and the 2nd Respondent on shops No. 53 Wunti Shopping Complex Bauchi. He argued that from the aforesaid positive findings of fact by the lower Court, it is very clear that the judgment of the trial Court is unassailable. He added that the pleading of the 2nd Respondent is well rooted. Cogent oral and documentary evidence establish the case of the 2nd Respondent that he was the person to whom shop No. 53, Wunti Shopping Complex Bauchi State has been allocated and that he paid the agreed sum, his payment was confirmed by the relevant authority, therefore the 1st and 2nd Appellants has no valid right or interest whatsoever on the subject matter. He concluded that the lower Court committed any error in the judgment hence this Court has no business whatsoever in disturbing the decision of the lower Court. He relied on the following cases NTEYOHO V UDO 1991 5 NWLR PT. 189 100, OGUNLEYE v. AINA 2011 3 NWLR PT. 1235 479, MBA V AGU 1998 9 SCNJ 34, BAKARE V BELLO 2002 FWLR PT. 107 1298. For the foregoing, he urged the Court to dismiss the appeal with substantial cost and affirm the decision of the trial Court.  On the first complaint of the Appellants that the Court granted relief not sought by the 2nd Respondent. To determine this, both the statement of claim and the judgment of the trial Court have to be visited. The statement of claim can be found from pages 3-7 of the record. In paragraph 19 of the statement of claim contained on page 6 of the record of appeal, the Plaintiff 2nd Respondent claimed as follows: Paragraph 19:- “The plaintiff whereof claims against the defendants jointly and severally A An Order of specific performance compelling the Defendants to deliver up possession or allow the Plaintiff access to the said shop No. 53 Wunti Shopping Complex, Bauchi being the original and rightful allotee of the said shop. B An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd Defendants from interfering with the plaintiff ownership and enjoyment of the said shop No. 53 Wunit Shopping Complex Bauchi. C General damages of N500,000. D Cost of this action.  The learned trial judge in his considered judgment concluded on pages 127-128 granted the following reliefs to the plaintiff 2nd Respondent- “a The Plaintiff having successfully established the claims against shop No. 53 is entitled to possession of the shop and I hereby order the 2nd Defendant to deliver up possession of shop No. 53 Wunti Shopping Complex forthwith. The Plaintiff being the rightful allottee and having paid its full value. b I hereby order a perpetual injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd Defendants from intruding with the Plaintiffs ownership of shop No. 53 and enjoyment thereof forthwith. c With the Plaintiff now having established in principles his legal entitlement, I hereby assessed all order for the payment of a general damages of the total sum of N150,000 only against the Defendants relying on Mrs. RONKE OMIYELE V MOBOLAJI MACAULEY & 4 ORS 2007 37 NSCQRL at page 906 ratio 6. d The cost of filing the matter and all fees and for other processes as asked is awarded against the Defendants in the sum of N1,600.10 only payable to the Plaintiff.”  The complaint in the main is that the Plaintiff asked for cost of action and the Court awarded cost of filing the suit. In my humble view, the complaint of the Appellant is unfounded and of no probative value. It is clear that the 2nd Respondent asked for cost of the action. The Court in its choice of word in awarding the cost christened it cost of filing the suit. Cost of action and cost of filing to me are one and same thing. The general rule is that cost follows event and a successful party is entitled to cost. The award or refusal of cost is at the discretion of the Court provided it is exercised judicially and judiciously. See NIGERIA NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION NNPC PENSION LIMITED v. VITA CONSTRUCTION LTD 2016 LPELR - 41259, UBN LTD v. NWAOKOLO 1995 6 NWLR PT. 400 127, STABILINI VISINONI LTD V MALLISON AND PARTNERS LTD 2014 15 NWLR PT. 1164 344, F.A. AKINBOBOLA V PLISSON FISKO NIGERIA LTD AND ORS 1991 1 NWLR PT. 167 270. The purpose of award of cost is for the purpose of meeting the legitimate expenses of the successful party either wholly or partially as the Court may deem fit. See ADEBUYI LAYINKA AND ANOR v. ADEOLA MAKINDE & ORS 2002 10 NWLR PT. 775 358. EKO JCA as he then was, now Justice of the Supreme Court in the case of LONESTAR DRILLING NIGERIA LIMITED v. NEW GENESIS EXECUTIVE SECURITY LTD 2011 LPELR 4437 said thus on categories of cost- “It is abundantly clear from the foregoing that costs fall in two broad species, namely the necessary expenses in the proceedings made by a party and the cost in terms of the litigants “time and effort in coming to Court\". The former category includes filing fees, and solicitors fees. This category belongs to the realm akin to special damages. They are easily ascertainable by producing for instance receipts. That is why the Rules classify them as expenses. The latter category which the Rule allow the litigant to be compensated for is the litigants “time and effort in coming to Court\". The Court under this category, usually take into account the number of appearances of the litigant and his Counsel in Court.”  I am not unmindful of the position of the law that a Court or Tribunal will not grant a prayer outside the ones set down in statement of claim, petition etc. See IGE FELIX OYEBISI V HON. TIJANI TUNDE SULEIMAN & ORS 2008 LPELR - 4288, UGO v. OBIEKWE 1989 1 NWLR PT. 99 566,THE NIGERIA AIR FORCE V WING COMMANDER T.I.A SHEKETE 2002 18 NWLR PT. 798 129, DR. T.E.A. SALUBI v. MRS BENEDICTA E. NWARIAKU 2003 7 NWLR PT. 819 426, AISHA JUMMAI ALAHASSAN AND ANOR VS MR DARIUS DICKSON ISHAKU AND ORS 2016 LPELR- 40083. Having shown that the cost granted by the Court is not what was not claimed but that which is claimed in paragraph 19 of the statement of claim by the Plaintiff 2nd Respondent this question therefore is answered in the negative.  What is next is whether in view of the evidence led, the trial Court was right to have entered judgment for the Plaintiff.  It is common ground that the duty of a trial Court is to adequately evaluate the evidence adduced in the case and make appropriate finding of fact in respect of all issues arising in the case and material to the determination of the case. SeeT.A.O. WILSON AND ORS v. A.B. OSHIN & ORS SCNLR 1215 at 1240. A. R. MOGAJI AND ORS V MADAM   RABIATU ODOFIN AND ORS 1978 4 SC 91. That is why in deciding whether a certain set of facts given in evidence by one party in a civil case before a Court in which both parties appears is preferable to another set of fact given in evidence by the other party, the trial judge, after a summary of all the facts must put the two set of facts on an imaginary scale, weigh one against the other then decide upon the preponderance of credible evidence which weigh more and acceptable in preference to the other and then apply the appropriate law to it. What I am saying in essence is that before a judge before whom evidence is adduced by the parties in a civil case comes to a decision as to which evidence he believes or accepts and which evidence he rejects, he should first of all put the totality of the testimony adduced by both parties on that imaginary scale, he will put the evidence adduced by the Plaintiff on one side of scale and that of the Defendant on the other side and weigh them together. He will then see which is heavier not by number of witnesses called by each party but by the quality or the probative value of the testimony of those witnesses. See the case of MUSA SHA JNR & ORS V DA RAP KWAN AND ORS 2000 8 NWLR PT. 670 685 at 705.   In the case at hand the Plaintiff 2nd Respondent testified to the effect of how he paid for the shop by two installments of N500,000.00 and N100,000.00 making up the N600,000.00 for the shop. Not these alone, he tendered document of offer Exhibit LD1 and Exhibit LD2-4 to show his respective payments and the letter of compliance by the chosen bank by the 1st Respondent. All these are not in dispute. Not these alone, the witnesses of Appellant who are staff of the Ministry Respondent confirmed the authenticity of the signature on Exhibit LD1. Meaning that Exhibit LD1 was not disputed. Therefore the complaint on which Exhibit LD1 is made is of no substance but an empty complaint. For the foregoing, I have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the learned trial judge adequately and properly evaluated the evidence before it and applied the appropriate law to it before arriving at the conclusion reached. By the foregoing, both the questions 3 & 4 on whether the Court relied on the weakness of the case of the Appellant and the issue of reference number on Exhibit LD1 are all answered in the negative. That is to say that the Exhibit LD1 is authentic and that the trial Court did not take advantage of the weakness of the case of the Appellant but the preponderance of the evidence of the 2nd Respondent in arriving at the conclusion reached.  In the final analysis, I resolve all the issues 2 - 5 against the Appellants. The result is that the appeal by the Appellants is lacking in merit and hence dismissed.  In consequence, the judgment of the High Court of Justice Bauchi State in suit BA512007 Coram Justice Moh’d A. Sambo is hereby affirmed.  Parties to bear their respective cost.   ADZIRA GANA MSHELIA, J.C.A.:  I had the advantage of reading the draft of the lead Judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Oniyangi, J.C.A, I agree that this appeal being devoid of merit should be dismissed. I abide by the orders in the lead Judgment, inclusive of costs.   BOLOUKUROMO MOSES UGO, J.C.A.:  I was privileged to read in draft the lead judgment of my learned brother MUDASHIRU NASIRU ONIYANGI, J.C.A. and I am in agreement with his reasoning and conclusion. I also dismiss the appeal.  Parties are to bear their respective costs.-end! " ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The 2nd Respondent was allocated shop No. 53, Wunti Shopping Complex Bauchi through a letter of allocation issued by the 1st Respondent (Ministry of Housing, Environment, Bauchi State) dated 3rd February, 2005. Therein, the 2nd Respondent was to pay a total sum of N600,000.00 to the 1st Respondent through Yankari Saving and Loan Limited. The 2nd Respondent paid and was issued receipts for the said sum by two installments of N500,000.00 and N100,000.00 dated 21st day of February, 2005 and 29th December, 2005 respectively. Consequently, the Yankari Saving and Loan Limited issued to the 2nd Respondent a letter of confirmation of payment which purpose was to authorize the 1st Respondent/Ministry to release the keys of the said shop to the 2nd Respondent.  When the 2nd Respondent presented the letter to the Ministry through the office of the 1st Appellant (Eng. Zabairu Yakubu), who was Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, 2nd Respondent allegedly abused and insulted by the 1st Appellant and possession refused. It emerged that the 1st Appellant/Permanent Secretary had allocated the shop to himself using the name of his son (2nd Respondent) as crony. Instructively, in 2005 when 2nd Respondent came for possession of the shop, neither the Permanent Secretary nor his son had made any payment on the shop. It was only on the 30th day of January, 2007 when the suit by the 2nd Respondent was pending that they made payment. Furthermore, they were only able to produce a certified letter of confirmation of payment dated 9th November, 2010, five years after the 2nd Appellant was issued his.  The trial judge after considering the case entered judgment in favour of the Plaintiff:-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  JAMES SHEHU ABIRIYI, J.C.A. Delivering the Lead Ruling:  This application brought pursuant to Order 7, Rules 4 and 8 and Order 6 Rule 9 of the Court of Appeal Rules, 2016 and under the inherent jurisdiction of this Court is for the following: 1. AN ORDER of this Honourable Court, granting leave to the AppellantsApplicants to amend their Notice of Appeal by amending paragraph 3 of the Notice of Appeal, Ground 2 of the Grounds of Appeal, adding Omnibus Ground to the Grounds of Appeal and inserting the capacity in which E. N. IMANDI, ESQ. signed the said Notice of Appeal No: CAYL1312019. 2. AN ORDER of this Honourable Court, deeming the Amended Notice of Appeal particularly, the copies filed separately as properly filed and served.  The Application is brought upon the following grounds: 1. That the AppellantsApplicants filed their Notice of Appeal on the 492018. 2. That JOHNSON ALTAJIRI, ESQ., one of the Counsel to the AppellantsApplicants after careful perusal of the Notice of Appeal discovered that there are needs to amend the said Notice of Appeal by amending paragraph 3 of the Notice of Appeal and Ground 2 of the Grounds of Appeal, to add Omnibus Ground to the Grounds of Appeal and insert the capacity in which E.N. IMANDI, ESQ. signed the said Notice of Appeal. 3. That this Application is necessary for the AppellantsApplicants to amend their Notice of Appeal and to be deemed as properly filed and served.  The motion is supported by an affidavit of eight 8 paragraphs to which two exhibits original notice of appeal exhibit A and a proposed amended notice of appeal exhibit B are annexed.  The 1st Respondent filed a counter affidavit in opposition of the application. Annexed to the 1st Respondent’s counter affidavit are exhibits R1, the original notice of appeal, R2, the Appellants brief of argument and R3, Respondent’s brief of argument.  From the affidavit in support of the motion on notice, the Applicants want to amend the original notice of appeal by adding an omnibus ground of appeal and indicate that E.N. Imandi signed the notice of appeal as counsel for the Appellants.  On the evidence contained in the counter affidavit, the 1st Respondent is opposing the application because briefs have been exchanged between the Applicants and the 1st Respondent and that the original notice of appeal is “fundamentally defective and incompetent.” That the amendment sought relates to issues on which arguments have been advanced.  In oral argument before the Court, learned counsel for the Applicants, relied on the affidavit in support of the application and urged the Court to grant the application.  Learned counsel for the 1st Respondent relied on the counter affidavit as well as the exhibits attached thereto. He pointed out that issues have been joined and that the 1st Respondent challenged two grounds argued as being incompetent.  He submitted that the amendments sought were overreaching.  Learned counsel for the 1st Respondent filed a list of authorities. In Okwuosa vs. Gomwalk 2017 9 NWLR Pt. 1570 259 and Okpe vs. Fan Milk Plc 2017 282, the notices of appeal were held to be incompetent because they were not signed by persons known to law but by law firms. In the instant notice, the 1st Respondent has not shown that the person who signed the notice of appeal is unknown to law, so those two cases are not applicable to this application. Odon vs. Barigha - Amange No. 1 2010 12 NWLR Pt. 1207 1 was in respect of an election appeal. Election appeals are sui generis and are not governed by ordinary civil Court Rules. So that case too is not applicable to the instant notice of appeal. In First Bank of Nigeria Plc v. May Medical Clinics And Diagnotics Centre Ltd & Anor  1996 9 NWLR Pt. 471 195 the application to amend the notice of appeal was dismissed because appellant was derelict. Appellant did not bother to forward the exhibits when he was compiling the record and he claimed also that part of the manuscript of the judgment was irretrievably lost. So this case is not helpful to the 1st Respondent.  However, the Court in this case FBN vs. May Medical Clinics supra held that leave to amend notice will be granted where there is mere irregularity in procedure in the filing of the process either by omission or commission. Leave to amend the notice of appeal will however not be granted if it will not cure the defect.  The Supreme Court has held in several cases that once a notice of appeal is competent it can be amended by alteration, addition or subtraction from the original ground of appeal filed.  See Fajebe & Anor vs. Opanuga 2019 LPELR-46348 SC. page 21 and Coker vs. United Bank For Africa Plc 1997 LPELR-880 SC.  The purpose of such amendment must be to ensure that the complaints of the appellant against the proceedings or judgment in question are laid and ventilated by the Court. The fact that briefs of argument have been filed and exchanged and an appeal virtually ready for hearing will not prevent the Court from exercising its undoubted discretion to allow an amendment both to the notice and grounds of appeal and the brief of argument so long as the amendment would serve the ends of justice and fairness and the other party can be compensated by costs. See First Bank of Nigeria Plc vs. May Medical Clinics And Diagnostics Centre Ltd & Anor 2001 LPELR-1282 SC page 27.  The failure of learned counsel for the Appellants to indicate that he was appearing for the Appellants does not render the notice of appeal incompetent. It was in my view a minor slip.  As the notice of appeal is competent, the Appellants should be allowed to ventilate their grievances against the proceedings and judgment of the Court below. It does not matter that the 1st Respondent has filed 1st Respondent’s brief of argument. 1st Respondent can be compensated by costs. 1st Respondent is awarded N30, 000.00 costs to be paid by the AppellantsApplicants.  The application is granted as prayed. 1. An Order is hereby made granting leave to the Appellants to amend their Notice of Appeal by amending paragraph 3 of the Notice of Appeal, Ground 2 of the Grounds of Appeal, adding Omnibus Ground to the Grounds of Appeal and inserting the capacity in which E. N. Imandi, Esq. signed the Notice of Appeal in Appeal No. CAYL1312018.  The Amended Notice of Appeal already filed on 16th May, 2019 dated 14th May, 2019 is deemed duly filed and served today.   CHIDI NWAOMA UWA, J.C.A.:  I read in advance a draft copy of the Ruling delivered by my learned brother JAMES SHEHU ABIRIYI, JCA. I agree with the order granting the application as prayed, to amend the Appellants’Applicants’ Notice of Appeal as sought. I abide by the order of costs made in the lead Ruling in favour of the 1st Respondent.   ABDULLAHI MAHMUD BAYERO, J.C.A.:  I agree.-end!   " ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  This arose from an interlocutory application brought pursuant to Order 7, Rules 4 and 8 and Order 6 Rule 9 of the Court of Appeal Rules, 2016 and under the inherent jurisdiction of this Court for the following: 1. AN ORDER of this Honourable Court, granting leave to the Appellants/Applicants to amend their Notice of Appeal by amending paragraph 3 of the Notice of Appeal, Ground 2 of the Grounds of Appeal, adding Omnibus Ground to the Grounds of Appeal and inserting the capacity in which E. N. IMANDI, ESQ. signed the said Notice of Appeal No: CA/YL/131/2019. 2. AN ORDER of this Honourable Court, deeming the Amended Notice of Appeal particularly, the copies filed separately as properly filed and served. The motion was supported by an affidavit of eight (8) paragraphs to which two exhibits (original notice of appeal exhibit A and a proposed amended notice of appeal exhibit B) wee annexed. From the affidavit in support of the motion on notice, the Applicants want to amend the original notice of appeal by adding an omnibus ground of appeal and indicate that E.N. Imandi signed the notice of appeal as counsel for the Appellants. In oral argument before the Court, learned counsel for the Applicants, relied on the affidavit in support of the application and urged the Court to grant the application. The 1st Respondent filed a counter affidavit in opposition of the application pointing out that issues have been joined and that the 1st Respondent challenged two grounds argued as being incompetent. He submitted that the amendments sought were overreaching.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  PAUL ADAMU GALUMJE, J.S.C. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  The Appellant herein, was arraigned before the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory on a two count charge of rape contrary to Sections 282 1a b and c and punishable under Section 283 as well as criminal force contrary to Section 265, all of the Penal Code Law. On the 12th of April, 2006, the two count charge was read and explained to the Appellant and he pleaded not guilty. In order to prove its case, the prosecution called four witnesses and tendered in evidence the statements of the prosecutrix, the prosecutrix's father, as well as that of the Appellant and they were admitted and marked Exhibits A, B and D respectively. Exhibit D was later expunged along with the evidence of PW3 who did not turn up for cross-examination. After a careful consideration of the evidence before him, the learned trial Judge in his reserved and considered judgment found the Appellant guilty as charged and sentenced him to ten years' imprisonment on count 1 and one-year imprisonment on count 2. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently.  The Appellant was dissatisfied with the decision of the trial Court. Being aggrieved, he appealed to the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division and submitted two issues for determination of his appeal. The two issues were resolved against him and his appeal was dismissed. Again, the Appellant is dissatisfied with the decision of the Court of Appeal and has now brought this appeal. His notice of appeal, filed on the 8th of July, 2016 contains three grounds of appeal. Parties filed and exchanged briefs of argument. Mr. Abdullahi Haruna, learned Counsel for the Appellant formulated three issues for determination of this appeal and they read as follows:- 1. Whether the prosecution can be said to have proved its case beyond reasonable doubt in view of the fact that the essential ingredients of the offences alleged against the Appellant were not established. 2. Whether the testimonies of both the PW2 and PW4 do not amount to hearsay evidence and thus not unsafe for the Court below to rely on while affirming the judgement of the Trial Court. 3. Whether the learned justices of the Court below were right to have upheld the Appellant's sentences of 10 years and 1-year imprisonment for the offences of Rape and criminal force respectively to run concurrently from the date of judgment 8th July, 2009 when the Appellant had been in prison custody since 12th April, 2006 a period of over 3 years before the date of judgment?  Mr. Ibrahim Angulu, learned counsel for the Respondent, leading two other counsel submitted two issues for determination of this appeal, in the following terms: 1. Whether the Respondent has proved its case of rape and criminal force beyond reasonable doubt to justify the conviction of the Appellant. 2. Whether the sentence of the High Court reaffirmed by Court of Appeal is legally right.  I have read the parties' briefs of argument and I am of the firm view that the only issue calling for determination of this appeal is whether the Lower Court was right in affirming the decision of the Trial Court, having regard to the evidence adduced at the trial, and if so whether the sentences passed on the Appellant are not excessive.  Learned Counsel for the Appellant in his argument, submitted that the prosecution failed to prove the essential element of the offence of rape, as it failed to prove that the Appellant's penis penetrated the vagina of PW1, the prosecutrix. Learned Counsel cited the authority of Posu v. State 2011 2 NWLR Pt. 1234 393 at 416-417, paras F-B, in support of his submission that where in a charge of rape, penetration of the vagina is not proved, the accused will be discharged.  On the sentence passed on the Appellant, Learned Counsel submitted that the sentence of 10 years and one year for the offences of rape and criminal force respectively is excessive, bearing in mind the age of the Appellant and for the fact that he is a first offender who has been dismissed from his employment as a result of this case. According to the learned counsel, these factors are enough to mitigate the punishment. In aid learned counsel cited and relied on the authority of Ekpo v. State 1982146 NSCC 146 at 155. In conclusion, learned counsel urged this Court to allow the appeal. In reply, Learned Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the prosecution did prove at the trial court all the ingredients of the offence of rape.  On the issue of sentence, Learned Counsel submitted that the Trial Court imposed the sentences in exercise of its discretionary powers and this Court can only interfere with such exercise if it is shown that the Trial Court acted under a misconception of the Law or under a misapprehension of facts. In aid, learned Counsel cited Nwadiogbu v. A.I.R.B.D.A. 2010 19 NWLR Pt.1226 364 at 381. Finally, Learned Counsel urged this Court to dismiss the appeal.   Section 282 provides as follows :- “2821 A man is said to commit rape who, save in the case referred to in Subsection 2, has sexual intercourse with a woman in any of the following circumstances: - a against her will; b without her consent; c with her consent, when her consent has been obtained by putting her in fear of death or of hurt. d With her consent, when the man knows that he is not her husband and that her consent is given because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully married. e With or without her consent, when she is under fourteen years of age or of unsound mind. 2 Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife is not rape, if she has attained to puberty.”  Section 283 of the same Penal Code provides as follows:- “Whoever Commits rape, shall be punished with imprisonment for life or for any less term and shall also be liable to fine.”  For the prosecution to prove the offence of rape, it must establish the following ingredients: - 1. That the accused had sexual intercourse with the woman in question. 2. That the act was done in circumstances following under any one of the five paragraphs in Section 282 1 of the Penal Code. 3. That the woman was not the wife of the accused; or if she was his wife that she had not attained puberty. 4. That there was penetration of the vagina of the victim no matter how slight by the accused's penis.  In the instant case, the Trial Court at page 154 paragraph two of the record of this appeal held:- “In the course of this judgment, I have held that the prosecution had established that the prosecutrix was under fourteen years of age. By Section 282 1e of the Penal Code, it is rape to have sexual intercourse with or without the consent of a girl who is under fourteen years of age. I have also found that the accused person had sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix. The cumulative effect of these findings is that the ingredients of an offence under Section 2821e of the Penal Code have been made out by the prosecution.”  At pages 251 of the record, the Appellant admitted under cross-examination that he had had sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix more than six or seven times before this one for which he is standing trial. With this admission, the question of penetration of the vagina of the prosecutrix is no longer in controversy. The question is whether the victim was below 14 years as at the time of the commission of the offence. PW2 the father of the prosecutrix who had the record of her birth gave evidence that she was 13 years at the material time. Whether she consented to the sexual intercourse or not, the Appellant's act of sexual intercourse with her amounted to rape.  On the issue of penetration of the vagina, PW1, the prosecutrix gave evidence that she was raped. PW4 the medical doctor, who treated PW1 on admission at Wuse General Hospital, testified at page 228 of the record of this appeal as follows:- “Further vaginal examination revealed fresh rim of hymen with a tear at the lower aspect of the vagina extending to the skin of the perineum. There was blood observed in the vagina and the area of laceration of the skin.”  Clearly, this piece of evidence corroborates the evidence of PW1 that she was raped. Not only that the evidence has clearly shown that there was penetration of the prosecutrix's vagina by the Appellant's penis. I have no doubt in my mind that the Appellant committed the offence of rape.  The question now is whether the Appellant used force against PW 1. PW 1 at page 172 of the Record of this appeal testified as follows: - “I went close to him and he grabbed me and told me that if I shout that Mopol is to kill and go. When I was scared to shout, he pulled off my pant, fall me down on the ground and raped me.” Pushing PW1 to the ground was clearly an act of criminal force. Since there is evidence of rape, any act of trespass to the body of PW 1 in preparation to commit an offence is clearly an act of criminal force. Criminal force is defined under Section 263 of the Penal Code thus:- \"Whoever intentionally uses force to any person without that person's consent: - a While preparing to commit any offence b In the course of committing any offence, or c Intending by the use of such force, he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the force is used is said to use criminal force to that other.” By this definition, the Appellant committed criminal force against PW1. The Lower Court was therefore right when it upheld the decision of the Lower Court on this score.  On the issue of the sentences, I agree with the learned counsel for the Respondent that the imposition of sentence on the Appellant was purely a matter of discretion. The Law is settled that the discretion of a Court must at all times be exercised not only judicially, but also judiciously on sufficient materials. See Udensi v. Odusote 2003 6 NWLR Pt.817 545 at 558 para B; Ogbuehi v. Governor Imo State 1995 9 NWLR Pt.417 53 University of Lagos v. M.I. Aigoro 1985 1 NWLR Pt.1 143 at 148.  It is equally settled that where judicial discretion has been exercised bona fide uninfluenced by irrelevant consideration and not arbitrarily or illegally by the Court, the general rule is that the Appellate Court will not interfere. The punishment for rape as provided under Section 283 of the Penal Code is life imprisonment, and a mandatory sentence of fine. The Trial Court imposed a sentence of ten years' imprisonment and left out the mandatory fine. I am of the firm view that the Trial Court was sufficiently magnanimous in the manner it imposes sentence of imprisonment. The learned trial Judge was also lenient in passing sentence under Section 265 of the Penal Code. I therefore have no reason to interfere with the exercise of the Trial Court's discretion which was affirmed by the Lower Court.   Finally, this appeal is against the concurrent findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeal and the attitude of this Court is that it will not interfere with those findings, unless it is shown that they are perverse. The Appellant has failed to convince me to so interfere with these concurrent findings. The sole issue formulated by me is therefore resolved against the Appellant. This being so, this appeal shall be and it is hereby dismissed.   OLABODE RHODES-VIVOUR, J.S.C.:  I was privileged to read in draft the leading judgment prepared by my learned brother GALUMJE, JSC. Learned counsel for the Appellant was unable to prove that concurrent findings of the two Courts below are wrong, I found them to be correct.  Accordingly, there is no merit in this appeal. It is also dismissed by me.   CHIMA CENTUS NWEZE, J.S.C.:  My Lord, GALUMJE, JSC, obliged me a draft of the leading judgement delivered now. I agree with His Lordship that, being unmeritorious, this appeal deserves to be dismissed. Appeal dismissed.   AMINA ADAMU AUGIE, J.S.C.:  I had a preview of the lead judgment just delivered by my learned brother, GALUMJE, JSC, and I agree with him that this Appeal totally lacks merit. The Court of Appeal was right to affirm the decision of the trial Court, which “was well-founded on the law and the fact”. I also agree with its decision not to disturb the sentence passed by the trial Court on the Appellant. As the Court of Appeal aptly said: It is common knowledge that the offence of rape is on the increase in this Country and Courts have a role to play in sending a clear message that it would not be tolerated and would be severely punished. Further, the Appellant, being a Police Officer at the time of the commission of the offence, was supposed to protect the Prosecutrix. He abused his position, used his profession to threaten, frighten and rape the helpless 13-year-old girl, the daughter of his fellow Policeman without shame. He had no excuse for what he had done and was lucky to have escaped with what I think was a light sentence, given the gravity and prevalence of the offence and the naked exercise of power.  In my view, it will amount to turning justice on its head if this Court disturbs the concurrent findings of the two Lower Courts that the Appellant was guilty as charged. The Appellant was a Policeman, who was supposed to protect a young girl, 13 years of age; instead he abused his position, and the trust reposed on him, by raping her. Thus, I also dismiss this Appeal in its entirety. Appeal dismissed.   EJEMBI EKO, J.S.C.:  I agree, as my learned brother, PAUL ADAMU GALUMJE, JSC, found and concluded that the conviction of the Appellant by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Lower Court, is not perverse.  The Appellant, citing the principle set out in EKPO v. THE STATE 1982 NSCC 146 at 155, had argued \"that the learned trial Judge erred in the principle by not taking into consideration the fact that the Appellant is a young first offender and ought to have exercised his discretion in imposing a minimal sentence which should commence running from the 12th April, 2006 when his detention in prison custody commenced\". In EKPO v. THE STATE supra this Court, on the facts of the case, stated that the trial Court is not bound to impose maximum sentence for an offence and that it is \"free to exercise its discretion in that regard\". The issue remains in the unfettered discretion of the trial Court. The settled principle on the power the appellate Court has to interfere with a discretion exercised by the Trial Court is that the appellate Court will not lightly interfere with a discretion properly exercised by the trial Court even if the Appellate Court would have exercised the same discretion differently. It is therefore incumbent on the Appellant to establish how the trial Court or the lower Court had exercised its discretion improperly.  This Court, by dint of Section 2331 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, is only empowered to hear and determine appeals from the Court of Appeal. It does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from the High Court or the trial Judge. The Appellant has, in my firm view, come to a wrong forum with his argument or complaint that the learned trial Judge erred in not applying the principle established in EKPO v. THE STATE supra and that he did not take into consideration the fact that the Appellant was a first offender in the order imposing custodial prison sentences for the offences of rape and criminal force. The Appellant, having come to the wrong forum, this Court will be acting ultra vires to interfere with the discretion exercised by the trial Court. It is on record though that the Lower Court had affirmed the sentences imposed on the Appellant.  Appeal dismissed.-end!" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  ITA GEORGE MBABA, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  This is an appeal against the judgment of Imo State High Court in Suit No. HOW8062017, delivered on 24th May, 2018, by Hon. Justice K.A. Ojiako, wherein the Court upheld the preliminary objection raised by the Respondent in part and dismissed the plaintiffs’ suit on the ground that it was caught up by the doctrine of estoppel and as such was an abuse of the Court process.  At the lower Court Appellants, as plaintiffs, had sought the following Reliefs: “aA declaration that the judgment of this Honourable Court in Suit No. HOW5812007delivered by Hon. Justice N.B. Ukoha on October 26, 2009, was obtained by fraud. b An order setting aside the judgment of this Honourable Court in Suit No. HOW5812007, delivered by Honourable Justice N.B. Ukoha on October 26, 2009, which was obtained by fraud.  Alternatively to A & B; An Order setting aside the part of the judgment of Honourable Justice N.B. Ukoha which awarded to the claimant in suit NO.HOW5812007 in the sum of N28,516,680.00 Twenty Eight Million Five Hundred and Sixteen Thousand Six Hundred and Eighty Naira as special damages for Nigerian treatment and the sum of 108,00.000 sic Lakh for her overseas treatment for having been obtained by fraud. c An Order for refund of the sum of N62,924,608.00 Sixty Two Million, Nine Hundred and Twenty- Four Thousand, Six Hundred and Eight Naira deposited in the Registry of the Court of Appeal, including interest accrued thereon. d An Order awarding special damages to the claimants.” Page 13 of the Records.  The summary of Appellants’ claim at the Court below was that some of the receipts tendered by the Respondent as claimant in Suit No. HOW5812007 were procured by fraudforgery. Therefore, since those receipts which were obtained by fraudforgery were the basis of the trial Court’s award of special damages in favour of the Respondent, those damages awarded by the trial Court in its judgment should be set aside for the obvious fraud.  The Respondent was served the originating processes of this suit How8062012 on the 6th of November, 2017 and instead of filing a defence to contradict the allegations of the Appellant that some receipts relied upon by the trial Court were obtained by fraudforgery, the Respondent filed a Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 22nd January, 2018, challenging, in limine, the jurisdiction of the lower Court to adjudicate over the Suit on the ground that the Suit at the lower Court was based on the issue of fraudforgery, which had been determined by the Court of Appeal in its interlocutory ruling on an interlocutory application filed by the Appellants in CAOW1462010, on 2832013.  Appellants had filed a counter affidavit to the preliminary objection, in opposition. The parties filed written addresses and after taking arguments on the preliminary objection, the trial Court, in a considered Ruling, delivered on 2452018, upheld the preliminary objection, in part, agreeing with the Respondent, that Appellants’ Suit as constituted, was caught up by the doctrine of issue estoppel. It also held that the suit was an abuse of the process of the Court. The lower Court proceeded to dismiss the suit and awarded cost of N350,000.00 Three Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira to the Respondent as cost, against the Appellants.  That is the decision Appellant appealed against, being aggrieved and dissatisfied. They filed their Notices of Appeal on 2552018 pages 698 to 704 of the Records of Appeal. They filed that brief of arguments on 29102018, which was deemed duly filed on 281118, and donated five5 issues for the determination of the Appeal, as follows: 1 Whether or not the issues in dispute in suit No. How8062017 and those in the Appellant’s Motion on Notice dated December 5, 2011, filed in Appeal No.CAOW1462010 are the same and were fully finally determined by the Court of Appeal, such as to form a valid ground for a successful plea of issue estoppel and the suit be deemed an abuse of the process of the Court? Ground 1,3 and 5 2 Whether or not the Lower Court, was right to dismiss the Appellants’ suit, despite the ruling of the Court of Appeal of 28032013 and the Lower Courts holding in its judgment that a judgment allegedly obtained by fraud can be set aside by a fresh action. Grounds 4 and 7. 3 Whether or not the lower Court was correct to hold that its hearing of the suit would amount to an attempt to set aside a decision already confirmed by the Court of Appeal and extinguish the subject of an appeal currently pending before the Supreme Court? Ground 6. 4 Whether or not the Appellants’ action can be said to be an after -thought? Ground 2 5 Whether or not in the circumstances of the suit at the Lower Court, the cost of N350,000 awarded in favour of the Respondent is not excessive and punitive? Ground 8  The Respondent filed her brief on 422019, which was deemed duly filed on 2732019, she distilled 3 issues for the determination of the Appeal as follows: 1 Whether this Honourable Court can rightly proceed to determine this appeal in the absence of vital records of appeal. 2 Having due regard to the Ruling of this Honourable Court on 2832010, in suit No.CAOW1462010, whether the trial high Court was right when it reached the decision that this suit is caught up by issue estoppel, abuse of process and is an afterthought, Grounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 3 Whether the trial Court exercised its discretion judicially and judiciously when it awarded N350,000.00 as cost to the Respondent, Ground 5. At the hearing of the Appeal on 322020, the Respondent’s Counsel applied to withdraw the issue one  Arguing the Appeal, Counsel for Appellants Mrs. Abisola Aarinola, on issues 1, 2 and 3 which she argued together said that the doctrine of issue estoppel per rem judicata has been judicially pronounced upon and established by our Courts in a plethora of cases, and most notably by the Supreme Court in Cole v. Jibunoh 2016 4 NWLR Pt.1503 499 at 521, where it was held: “Where a Court of competent jurisdiction has finally settled a matter in dispute between parties, neither party nor their privies may re-litigate that issue under the guise of a fresh suit, because the matter is said to be res-judicata.\"  Counsel listed the conditions that must co-exist for the plea of res-judicata to be established as stated in the said case of Cole v. Jibunoh supra, namely: “aThe parties in the previous action and the present one must be same; b The subject matter of the litigation in the previous action must be the same as the one in the present or new action; c The claim in the previous action must be given the same as the one in the present action; d The decision in the previous action must be given by a Court of competent jurisdiction; e The decision given in the previous action must be final or it must have finally disposed of the rights of the parties.\"  Counsel stressed that the party seeking to rely on the plea must establish andor fulfill all of the above stated conditions Okukuje v. Akwido 2001 3 NWLR Pt.700318 - 319. He argued that that was not established in this case at hand; that the trial Court was wrong to hold that the suit was caught up by the doctrine of res-judicata, when she said that Appellants were estopped from re-litigating the issue of the procurement by fraudforgery of several of the receipts tendered by the Respondent in the suit No. HOW5812997, upon which the trial Court based and gave its judgment and awarded damages, on the grounds that the same issue had been finally determined by a panel of this Honourable Court in its ruling, delivered on 2832013, on Appellants’ interlocutory application dated 5122011, made in Appeal No. CAOW1462010.  Counsel said this suit HOW8062017, between Julius Berger Nigeria Plc & Anor v. Mrs. Philomena Ugo, is strictly that of the question of –  “Whether the Respondent Committed fraudforgery in obtaining judgment at the trial Court in Suit No. HOW5812007?\"  Counsel referred us to reliefs sought in the suit as earlier reproduced in this judgment. Counsel also referred us to the Appeal No.CAOW1462010 to say that the issue therein as per the interlocutory application of 5122011, was whether or not the Appellants had made a case for the favourable exercise of the Court’s discretion to grant them leave to adduce fresh evidence? She said that the Appeal No. CAOW1462010 was entered on issues of negligence, as found by the High Court in its judgment delivered on 26102009, as well as the issue of quantum of damages awarded, based upon the finding of negligence; she said that the Court of Appeal, delivered its judgment on the substantive appeal on 522015 and dismissed same, while allowing in part, the Respondent’s Cross Appeal; that the judgment of the Court of Appeal did not contain any a valuation of issues of fraudforgery, neither did it make any declarations in respect of it.  Counsel said Appellants’ interlocutory application, referred to in paragraph 4.10 of their brief, was heard, refused and struck out on the ground that the evidence which Appellants were seeking leave to bring in would amount to substituting or replacing the evidence that was tendered at the trial Court and evaluated by the said Court; that the rationale behind the Court of Appeal decision to refuse the application was based on the fact that the facts of the fraudforgery committed by the Respondent and discovered by the Appellants were not properly pleaded at the trial Court; that issues were joined on them, but the trial Court did not get the opportunity to hear and evaluate the said facts and evidence. Counsel referred us to the holding of the Appeal Court on the CAOW1462010, where it was held, on page 36 of the judgment, as follows:- “It is undoubtedly clear from the state of pleadings of the parties at the trial Court, no issue of fraud or forgery was raised therein by the AppellantsAppellants. That is, fraud was not an issue pleaded or submitted for adjudication  The case of the AppellantsApplicants at the Trial Court clearly excludes any evidence of fraudforgery and it is not pleaded, the Court of Appeal cannot consider the reception of the evidence without an amendment of the pleadings.”  Counsel then said that a close examination of the issues highlighted above would reveal that the issue of fraudforgery, as brought for determination in suit No. HOW8062017 has not been determined by any Court of competent jurisdiction prior to the suit HOW8062017; that the issue of fraudforgery was not placed before the Court in HOW5812007 as confirmed by the Court of Appeal in the above ruling. As such, Counsel said the trial Court in HOW8062017, made no findings or declarations on it in its judgment, delivered on 26102009; she said that the issue of fraudforgery was also not part of the issues for determination by the Court of Appeal, in the substantive appeal; that issue of fraudforgery was only brought up, in passing, as the reason for the leave that was being sought in the interlocutory application filed by Appellant on December 5, 2011, but was not itself the issue to be decided by the Court of Appeal.  Counsel added that the consideration of the interlocutory application CAOW14610 which centred on whether or not the Court should exercise its discretion and allow the evidence of fraudforgery to be brought in at the appeal stage, and which the Appeal Court refused, cannot even be looked at as same was raised in an interlocutory application, not in the substantive caseappeal; she said that the Courts are barred from delving into the merits of substantive issues at the point of considering interlocutory application EFP Co. Ltd v N.D.I.C. FWLR Pt. 367 793 at 812.  Again, Appellants’ Counsel said that the Court of Appeal, in considering their interlocutory application for leave to adduce further fresh evidence, did not consider the issue of fraudforgery as issue for determination, and could fraudforgery could have been proved were not have considered same, because the facts and evidence by which fraudforgery could have been proved were not placed before the Court in the Appellants’ motion of 5122011.  Counsel said the trial Court erred in its evaluation of the issues, when it held that the aim of the Appellants’ interlocutory application was to set aside the judgment on appeal on grounds of fraudforgery. Rather, that it was for leavepermission to adduce the evidence of fraudforgery, which evidence would then have assisted the Court of Appeal in the determination of the substantive appeal, to make a declaration on the issue of fraudforgery as relates to the judgment of the trial Court in suit No. HOW5812007, as the issue of fraudforgery, being a substantive issue, could only have been dealt with in the substantive appeal and not in an interlocutory application.  Thus, counsel said the issues in this case HOW8062017 and the issues in CAOW1462010, are not the same and as such cannot form a valid ground for the plea of res jurdicata. She added that issues of fraudforgery, alleged against the Respondent, were not determined at the trial Court in Suit No. HOW5812007, neither were they considered and determined in the substantive appeal in CAOW1462010, nor in the interlocutory application for leave to adduce fresh evidence in the said CAOW1462010.  Counsel said the trial Court even confused the Ruling in the interlocutory application to adduce fresh evidence in CAOW1462010, delivered on 28313, with the trial judgment of the Court of Appeal in that Appeal, delivered on 522015. He argued that the Ruling of 28313, in CAOW1462010, was not a final decision of the Court of Appeal, on the issue to lie plea of res judicata, because it did not finally and fully resolve the issue of commission of fraudforgery. He added that even in the final judgment of 522015 in CAOW1462010, the Court of Appeal did not make any pronouncements or findings on whether the Respondent did, indeed, commit fraudforgery in obtaining the judgment in suit No. HOW5812007, therefore, even that final judgment of the Court of Appeal did not touch on issues of fraudforgery.  Counsel also argued that the procedure adopted by Appellants to seek redress was proper, that is, by means of HOW8062017 seeking to nullify, the decision in HOW5812007, on grounds [of] being obtained by fraudforgery, instead of filing fresh action to establish fraudforgery by the Respondent. He cited authorities to say that a party has the vires to file a fresh action urging the Court to set aside a judgment obtained by fraudforgery or deceit. Igwe v. Kalu 2002 4 NWLR Pt. 787 453; Abacha v. Kurastic Nig. Ltd 2014 LPELR - 22703 CA.  Counsel said the Trial Court was wrong to hold that Appellants, having appealed to the Court of Appeal in CAOW1462010, against the decision in HOW5812007, should have stayed on that line of procedure, and not file fresh suit to set aside the same judgment HOW5812007 appealed against in CAOW1462010.  Counsel relied on Vulcan Gases Ltd v. Gesellchaft Fur Industries & Anor. 2001 9 NWLR Pt.719 610 - wherein, she said the Supreme Court held that a judgment obtained by fraud can be set aside by either proceeding on appeal or by filing a fresh action.  Counsel further argued that, even where the judgment of a Trial Court has been confirmed by an Appellate Court, if it is discovered and established later on that the judgment at the Trial Court was obtained by fraud or upon a fraudulent set of facts, the said judgment is still liable to be set aside by a Court, such as the trial Court, despite the confirmation or affirmation by the Appellate Court. She relied on the authority of their Lordships in the decision in Duchess of Kingstons case 1775 - 1802 All ER. Rep. 623 per De Grey CJ at pages 629 - 630: “Fraud is an extrinsit, collateral act, which vitiates the most solemn proceedings of Courts of Justice. Lord Coke says it avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical or temporal.”  She added that such vitiating factor vitiates the judgment and affects the foundation of the judgment, robbing it of its potency, along with all subsequent orders or directives made, based on it, voiding it abinitio; she relied on UAC v. Macfoy 1961 3 All ER1169 –“one cannot put something on nothing and expects it to stand, it will collapse.”  Counsel further disclosed that the suit No. HOW5812007 was based on negligence and damages flowing therefrom; that the subsequent appeal No. CAOW1462010 was upheld by the Court of Appeal, and a subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court was pending; that issue of fraudforgery was not the question before the Supreme Court in the appeal.  She urged us to resolve the issues for Appellants, saying that the decision of the Supreme Court in the pending Appeal at the Supreme Court No.SC842015 will not conflict with the outcome of the trial in suit No. HOW8062017.  On issue 4, Counsel said the action of the Appellants suit No. HOW8062017 was not an afterthought, as the issues in HOW5812007, are verifiable from CAOW1462010 and from this suit. He repeated some of the arguments earlier made on the issues 1 to 3.  On issue 5, Counsel said the sum of N350,000.00, awarded as cost, was excessive, and urged us to interfere with it, relying on Oyedeji v. Akinyele 2001 FWLR Pt.77 970; Olokunlade & Anor v. Samuel & Ors 2010 LPELR - 3942 CA; Citibank Nig Ltd & Anor v. Ikediashi 2014 LPELR - 22447 CA; ACB Ltd &Anor v. Ajugwo 2011 LPELR - 3637 CA; UBN & Anor v. Nwaokolo 19956 NWLR Pt.400127.  He urged us to also resolve the issues 4 and 5 for Appellants, and to allow the Appeal.   The Respondent’s Counsel, Emeka Ozoani Esq., SAN who settled the brief, arguing issue 2, said the Trial Court had reached the right decision, that the suit was caught up by issue estoppel, having regard to the Ruling of this Court in Appeal No.CAOW1462010, delivered on 2832010 sic 2832013.  The Respondent reproduced the order sought by the Appellants in their motion of 5122011 in CAOW1462010, namely: “An order granting leave to the AppellantsApplicants to adduce further evidence in this Appeal by affidavit.\"  And the grounds for seeking the application were: 1 After the delivery of the judgment of the Lower Court which judgment form the basis of this appeal, and upon the Lower Court granting a conditional stay that the judgment be deposited in Court, the AppellantApplicant conducted routine investigations to ascertain the authenticity of most of the documentsreceipts tendered by the Respondent in the trial of the suit before the lower Court. 2 That further to the above, it was discovered that a whole lot of the documentsreceipts relied upon the Respondent before the lower Court were forged and non-existent. 3 The AppellantsApplicants subsequently reported the matter to the police and the police formally investigated the matter and arraigned the Respondent before the Magistrate Court, Owerri, Imo State on charge of forgery in charge number OW373C2011: COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VS PHILOMENA UGO. Page 44 of the Records of Appeal.  Counsel disclosed that the above charge was struck out by learned Chief Magistrate for being an abuse of the Court process as observed by the Trial Court on page 686 of the Records of Appeal; he said that the Appeal Court, on 2832013, held dismissing the application thus: “On the whole, it is my firm view that the evidence sought to be adduced as fresh evidence are at best substitutive evidence and this Court has no power to admit such substitutive evidence. Substantive appeal is now adjourned to 17th April, 2013 for hearing.”  Counsel said Appellants did not appeal against that Ruling of 2832013. And that, on 522015, the substantive appeal was determined and the Appeal dismissed for lacking in merit, while Respondent’s Cross Appeal succeeded in part. He said that Appellants had appealed against the said final judgment of the Court of Appeal in CAOW1462010, and further filed a motion at the Supreme Court for stay of execution of the judgment pages 567 to 572 of the Records of Appeal.  Counsel referred us to prayer 2 and ground 3 of the said motion for stay at the Supreme Court: “Prayer 2: An order releasing forthwith to the 1st AppellantApplicant, the total judgment sum of N62,924,608.00 Sixty Two Million Nine Hundred and Twenty Four Thousand, Six Hundred and Eight Naira, deposited in the Registry of the Court of Appeal pursuant to its ruling made on February 28,2011. Ground 3: The total monetary awards by the Trial Court and Court of Appeal amount to about N700,000.000.00 Seven Hundred Million Naira.\"  Counsel said that after about 9 years of the judgment of the trial Court, Appellants brought the present suit HOW8062017, seeking to impeach the judgment of the trial Court in the Suit HOW5812007, despite the pendency of the appeal at the Supreme Court, and after the unsuccessful attempt at the Court of Appeal to change the judgment by resort to seeking to adducing fresh evidence, that the judgment was obtained by fraudforgery!  Counsel agreed that a party can seek to set aside a judgment on ground of fraud, by either an appeal against that judgment, or by bringing of fresh action to set it aside Vulcan Gases Ltd v. Gesellschaft Fur Industries A.G. 2001 9 NWLR Pt.719 610 at 668, but he added that, after Appellants had opted for the former appeal against the judgment, unsuccessfully or when that process is still on, cannot take to the other option of filing fresh action at the High Court to set aside the same judgment!  He submitted that the principle of estoppel would apply, as held by the trial Court, to stop Appellants from re-litigating the issue. He relied on the case of ODJEVWEDJE & Anor v. ECHANOKPE 1987 1 NWLR Pt.52 632 at 654 - 655 on the principles the two kinds of estoppel. He also relied on Ntuks v. NPA 2007 All FWLR Pt.387 809, where, he said a similar scenario, as in this case, played out.  He submitted that the parties in this case are the same with those of the previous suit HOW5812007; the issues are the same; that the ruling of the Court of Appeal CAOW1462010 had determined the issues to finality which is the subject of matter further appeal to the Supreme Court.  Counsel further relied on the case of Ntuks and Ors v. NPA supra to say that raising the issue of fraud by the Appellants as in the interlocutory application in CAOW1462010 and in this case HOW8062017 was an after-thought, and urged us to resolve the issue against Appellants.  On issue 3, whether the cost of N350,000 awarded was excessive, Counsel answered in the negative and said that the issue became merely academic as Appellants had paid the cost already, while the Appeal No. CAOW1462010 was pending. He relied on the case of ECOBANK Vs HONEYWELL FLOUR MILLS  2018 LPELR - 45124 SC. Counsel also relied on Section 141 of the Court of Appeal Act to say that Appellants cannot bring a ground of appeal to challenge the cost awarded against it. He further relied on SPDC Vs Registrar of Business Premises, Abia State 20153 CAR 433 at 451.  Counsel also said that the general principle of law is that cost follows events; that a judgment creditor is always awarded cost and the same is at the discretion of the Court, to be exercised judicially and judiciously. He said that the Trial Court had exercised its discretion property and relied on Julius Berger Nig Plc v. IGP & Ors 2018 LPELR - 46127 CA.  Counsel urged us to resolve the issue too against Appellant, and to dismiss the Appeal.  RESOLUTION OF THE ISSUES I think the two remaining issues for the determination of this Appeal, distilled by the Respondent, are more apt and good summaries of the five issues donated by the Appellant.  Appellants’ issues 1, 2, 3 and 4 are properly located in the Respondent’s issue 2 which I rephrase thus: “Having regard to the Ruling of this Honourable Court, delivered on 2832013 in Appeal No. CAOW1462010, whether the Trial Court was right to hold that Appellants’ suit No. HOW8062017 was caught - up by issue estoppel and was an abuse of the Court process, and was an afterthought.” Grounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Appeal.  Of course, the issue 5 by Appellant agrees with the Respondent’s issues 3.  Was the Suit No. HOW8062017 caught-up by issue estoppel, abuse of the Court process and an afterthought? The reliefs sought by the Appellants in suit No. HOW8062017 have already been reproduced in this judgment, as follows: “aA declaration that the judgment of this Honourable Court in Suit No. HOW5812007 delivered by Hon. Justice N.B. Ukoha on October 26, 2009, was obtained by fraud. b An order setting aside the judgment of this Honourable Court in Suit No. HOW5812007, delivered by Honourable Justice N.B. Ukoha on October 26, 2009, which was obtained by fraud Alternatively to A & B; An Order setting aside the part of the judgment of Honourable Justice N.B. Ukoha which awarded to the claimant in suit NO.HOW5812007 in the sum of N28,516,680.00 Twenty Eight Million Five Hundred and Sixteen Thousand Six Hundred and Eighty Naira as special damages for Nigerian treatment and the sum of 108,00.000 sic Lakh for her overseas treatment for having been obtained by fraud. c An Order for refund of the sum of N62,924,608.00 Sixty Two Million, Nine Hundred and Twenty- Four Thousand, Six Hundred and Eight Naira deposited in the Registry of the Court of Appeal, including interest accrued thereon. d An Order awarding special damages to the claimants.” Page 13 of the Records.  It is also clear that the suit No. HOW5812007 was between the same parties in this case HOW8062017 and in this Appeal, as well as in Appeal No. CAOW1462010 See pages 3, 71 and 118 of the Records of Appeal, for the statements of claim, in HOW8062017, HOW5812007 and the Ruling in CAOW1462010, respectively.  There is also no dispute that the decision in HOW5812007 was the subject matter of Appeal No.  CAOW1462010, which has been determined, finally, by this Court in favour of the Respondent on 5215, and Appellants’ appeal dismissed. Before the final determination of the Appeal No.CAOW1462010 on 5215, Appellants had sought this Court Court of Appeal for “an Order granting leave to the AppellantsApplicants to adduce further evidence in this appeal by affidavit evidence.” The further evidence which Appellants wanted to adduce, if granted the leave, was that: “1 After the delivery of the judgment of the Lower Court, which judgment form the basis of this appeal, and upon the Lower Court granting a conditional stay that the judgment debt be deposited in Court, the AppellantsApplicants conducted routine investigations to ascertain the authenticity of most of the documentsreceipts tendered by the Respondent in the trial of the suit before the lower Court. 2 That further to the above, it was discovered that a whole lot of the documentsreceipts relied upon by the Respondent before the lower Court were forged and non-existent. 3 The AppellantsApplicants subsequently reported that matter to the police and the police formally investigated the matter and arraigned the Respondent before the Magistrate’s Court, Owerri, Imo State on a charge of forgery on charge Number OW373C2011; COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VS PHILOMENA UGO.\" See pages 119 of the Records.  There is also consensus by the parties that this Court, on the 2832013, refused the application, and the same was dismissed. This Court held: “The law is settled that a Court has a duty to prevent the improper use of its machinery and will not allow it to be used as a matter of vexation and oppressive behaviour in the process of litigation. See BenaPlastic Industries Ltd v. MV \"ANATOLIY VASILVEY\" & ORS 199910 NWLR Pt.624 20. Given the background facts of this case, even though Exhibit A, the charge sheet against the Respondent, was founded on the subject of this appeal, the instant application to adduce fresh evidence is not an abuse of Process of Court, in that the AppellantsApplicants are not litigating again on this same issue which had already been litigated upon between the Appellants and the Respondent based upon facts on which a decision had already been reached. The case been sic prosecuted at the Magistrate Court against the Respondent is on the allegation of fraudforgery, which we hold is not an issue before this Court. On the whole, it is my firm view that the evidence sought to be adduced as fresh evidence are at best substitutive evidence and this Court has no power to admit such substitutive evidence, more over fraudforgery was not part of the pleadings of the parties at the trial Court and neither was it an issue submitted to trial Court for adjudication. On the whole, this application lacks merit and it is hereby dismissed.” See pages 155 to 156 of the Records.  The above shows that the attempt by Appellants to introduce fresh issues, alleging fraud and forgery by the Respondents to obtain the judgment in HOW5812007, was resisted by the Respondent, and refused by the Court of Appeal, especially as Appellants in their pleadings at the trial Court in HOW5812007, did not plead the alleged fraudforgery. See the Ruling of 2832013 in CAOW1462010. Having therefore failed to plead the alleged fraudforgery in their statement of defence in HOW5812007, and the case adjudged in favour of the Respondents, and Appellants having also failed in their attempt to invokeintroduce the alleged fraudforgery at appeal level, to impeach the said judgment or to manipulate the legal process by use of the police to charge the Respondent for fraudforgery in Charge No. OW373C2011 wrongly, Appellants, in my view, was embarking on gross abuse of the judicial process, as the trial Court held, when they took out this suit HOW8O62017, seeking “declaration that the judgment in suit No.HOW5812007, delivered by Honourable Justice N.B. Ukoha on October 26, 2009, was obtained by fraud and an order setting aside the judgment for having been obtained by fraud.”  It is more so, and in my view, a demonstration of crass impunity and mischief by Appellants and their Counsel to adopt this strange procedure, after the unsuccessful attempt to introduce that line of evidence of fraudforgery at Appeal stage into the suit failed as per the Ruling of this Court in CAOW1462010, delivered on 2832013! Appellant never appealed against that Ruling! Also the attempt to implicate the Respondent in the Magistrate’s Court in Charge No.OW.373C2011 failed, being adjudged abuse of the Court process Page 686 of the Records. And the substantive Appeal in CAOW1462010, also failed, as the Respondent’s judgment in HOW5812007 was upheld and affirmed!  Appellants are currently in the Supreme Court, on Appeal, against the said decision of this Court, reached on 5215 affirming the rights of the Respondent in the said suit No. HOW5812007. But rather than pursue that further appeal at the Supreme Court andor wait for the determination of same.  Appellants elected to file this fresh action HOW8062017, over seven years after taking the option of appeal to set aside the judgment in HOW5812007, to impeach the same judgment of the trial Court in HOW5812007, determined since 2009!  I lack appropriate words to describe the depth of the depravity, impunity and abuse of the Court process, displayed by Appellants and their Counsel in this case! No lawyer worth his name should engage in this type of practice, which appears as a deliberate act of mischief to frustrate, annoy and oppress a successful party in litigation, pretending to pursue a Court process. In the case of Edjerode v. Ikine 2001 LPELR - 1479 SC, it was held: “The law is that abuse of Court process in regard to multiple actions between the same parties on the same subject matter may arise when a party improperly used judicial process to the irritation, annoyance and harassment of his opponent, not only in respect of the same subject matter, but also in the same issues in other actions.” See also Okafor v. AG Anambra State 19916 NWLR Pt.200 659 at 681; Saraki v. Kotoye 1992 9 NWLR Pt.264 156.  In Globe Motors Holdings Ltd Vs Honda Motor Co. Ltd 1998 5 NWLR Pt.550 373 at 381, the Supreme Court said: “An instance of such abuse “is in form of vexatious and oppressive actions” When an action is instituted deliberately to circumvent the cause of justice and to bring the judicial process into ridicule and contempt “Any action or course of conduct that is seen designed to introduced anarchy into the judicial system must be dealt with appropriately”. See also Dingyadi v. INEC No.2 201018 NWLR Pt.1224 154 SC; 2010 LPELR - 952 SC.”  As argued by the learned Senior Counsel for Respondent, a party who seeks to set aside a judgment of the Court, for having been obtained by fraud, can do so by either of two ways, namely by means of appeal against the said judgment, or by means of a fresh action for motion in the same Court seeking to set aside the said judgment. See Vulcan Gases Ltd v. Gesellschaft Fur Industries A.G. 2001 9 NWLR Pt.719 610 at 668.  The party, in my opinion, cannot take the two options simultaneously, or after the failure of the other. The above scenario seemed to have played out in the case of Onwuneme & Anor v. Customary Court Mbawsi & Ors 2018 LPELR - 44474 CA, where Appellant, while pursuing an appeal against a decision of the Customary Court at the Customary Court of Appeal, also filed a motion at the High Court, seeking to quash the said same judgment of the Customary Court. We held as follows: “Surprisingly, Appellants abandoned their appeal at the Customary Court of Appeal and went on a frolic to the High Court, with what I consider a ridiculous prerogative writ to quash a legitimate decision of the Customary Court, which they were also appealing against in CCUMA52002 at the Customary Court of Appeal formally. I think that was a gross abuse of the Court process. Appellant should have pursued the appeal against that decision of the customary Court of Appeal, or make the decision of the Customary Court of Appeal the subject matter of the prerogative writ as was the case of CCA Edo State v. Aguele &Ors supra.”  The prerogative writ was an abuse of the Court process and was dismissed. That same fate was to be-fall this case. Of course, the issue of estoppel came to the fore, as rightly held by the learned trial Court, when it held: It is clear that the plaintiff’s had sought to lead evidence on appeal, on forgery of the said receipts to impugn or set aside the judgment... Having sought to set aside the judgment by way of appeal and was so refused, they cannot turn round to attempt to actualize the said desire by this action. The plaintiffs are bound by the said decision of the Court of Appeal in the said application. This is based on the trite principle of law, that a party is precluded from contending the contrary or opposite of any specific point, which, having once been distinctly, put in issue and has with certainly and solemnity, been determined against him. There is no appeal against the said decision of the Court of Appeal over the said application, and my attention had been drawn to the fact that same has been set aside. The objection succeeds on this score and I hold that the plaintiffs are estopped from filing this action, seeking to set aside the judgment of the High Court in HOW5812007 on grounds of fraud, premised on the said same substitutive evidence. See pages 691 and 693 of the Records of Appeal.  The case of Ntuks & Ors v. NPA 2007 All FLWR Pt.387 809 is quite instructive, on issue estoppel and the principles of res-judicata, generally, when the Supreme Court said: It is now firmly settled that, where a Court of competent jurisdiction has settled by final decision, the matter in dispute between parties, none of the parties or their privies may re-litigate that issue again by bringing a fresh action. The matter is said to be resjudicata. The estoppel created is one by record, inter-parties. Thus, a successful plea of resjudicata ousts the jurisdiction the jurisdiction of the Court in the proceedings in which it is raised.  See the case of Ukaegbu & Ors v. Ugoji & Ors 1991 6 NWLR Pt.196 127; Osunrinde & Ors v. Ajamogun & Ors 1992 6 NWLR Pt.246156 at 183 - 184 and Alhaji Ladimeji & Anor Vs Salami &Ors 1998 5 NWLR Pt.548 1 at 13. The principle of resjudicata applies where a final judicial decision has been pronounced by a judicial TribunalCourt having competent jurisdiction over the cause or matter in litigation and over the parties thereto, disposes once and for all of the matters decided, so that they cannot after wards be raised for re-litigation between the same parties or their privies. See Agu v. Ikewibe 19914 SCNJ 56.  That, of course remains the law, and no party is expected to re-litigate a suit which had been heard and determined finally by a competent Court by any guise simply because he may have discovered something which he failed to employ at the time the case was heard which if applied, would have tilted the balance of the case to favour him. Appellants’ attempt to resort to claims of fraudforgery against the Respondent, for which they sought to lead fresh evidence on appeal CAOW1462010, to change the judgment of Court in HOW5812007 clearly shows the motive for embarking on this ill-fated suit HOW6062017. They Appellants are not happy with the judgment in HOW5812007 and want it frustrated and defeated, at all cost! Of course, having taken part in the trial of the suit HOW5812007 to conclusion, and having also used Appeals to defeat that decision unsuccessfully thus far, Appellants must bow to the outcome of the existing judicial process in the case, which are binding on them. See Tukur v. Umar UBA & Ors 2012 LPELR - 9337 SC: “Generally, estoppel means a bar that prevents one from asserting a claim or right that contradicts what one has said or done before or what has been legally established as true. A bar that prevents the re-litigation of issues.\" Per Ariwoola JSC There would be no end to litigation, if a party is allowed to re-open his cases, already tried to finality, each time he comes to see what he would use to tilt the outcome of the case in his favour, if used, which he failed to use. I therefore resolve the issue one against the Appellant.  On issue 2, which quarrels with the award of N350.000 as cost against Appellants. I think the Respondent’s Counsel stated the law partly when he argued that Appellants’ have no right of appeal against order of cost by the trial Court. Section 141 of the Court of Appeal Act, 2004, provides as follows: “Where, in the exercise by the High Court of a State or, as the case may be, the Federal High Court of its original jurisdiction, an interlocutory order or decision is made in the course of any suit or matter, an appeal shall with the leave of that Court or of the Court of Appeal lie to the Court of Appeal, but no appeal shall lie from any order made ex-parte or by consent of parties, or relating only as to cost.”  That is a throwback to Section 241 2c of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended which says: “2 Nothing in this section shall confer any right of appeal- c without the leave of the Federal High Court or a High Court or the Court of Appeal, from a decision of the Federal High Court or High Court made with the consent of the parties or as to cost only.” See the case of SPDC Vs Registrar of Business Premises Abia State 2015 LPELR - 24285 CA; 20153 CAR - 433 at 451, where it was held: “Thus, apart from the Appellant trying to preempt the Respondent’s case by raising that issue, it also lacks power to raise the complaint as that would be an attempt to fault ex-parte order of the Trial Court, or appeal against it contrary to Section 141 of the Court of Appeal Act, 2004, which says –“but no appeal shall lie from any order made ex-parte, or by consent of the parties or relating only to cost.” It would appear the bar applies only where the appeal is as to cost only awarded by the trial Court. Thus, where the complaint against cost is one of the grounds of the appeal or issue, therein, I think the Appellate Court can entertain it.  But the issue of cost to be awarded is always at the discretion of the trial Court or Court making the award and can only be faulted, if it was not exercised judicially and judiciously. See Mbonu & Ors v. Nwagbara & Ors 2018 LPELR - 44711 CA; Nwawka v. Adikamkwu 2014 LPELR - 22927 CA Shanusi &Ors v. Odugbemi & Anor 2017 LPELR 43377 CA; Saeby v Olaogun, Akinbobola v. Plisson Fisko Nig. Ltd 19911 NWLR Pt.167270 SC.  I do not see any reason to disturb the cost awarded by the trial Court, I resolve this issue too against the Appellants.  I see no merit in this appeal, which for me, is a gross abuse of the Court process, an after-thought and a violation of the cherished principles of res-judiciata, particularly, issue estoppel.  I dismiss the Appeal and award cost of Five Hundred Thousand Naira Cost N500,000.00 against the Appellants, payable to the Respondent.   AYOBODE OLUJIMI LOKULO-SODIPE, J.C.A.:  I agree.   IBRAHIM ALI ANDENYANGTSO, J.C.A.:  Having gone through the process filed in this appeal, and having been privileged to read in draft the judgment of my Learned Brother I.G. Mbaba JCA, just delivered, I agree in toto with his reasoning and conclusions.  I have nothing further to add. The appeal lacks merit and is equally dismissed by me, abiding by the order of cost therein made.-end!" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  At the lower Court, the Appellants as plaintiffs, had sought, among other reliefs, the following: “(a)A declaration that the judgment of this Honourable Court in Suit No. HOW/581/2007delivered by Hon. Justice N.B. Ukoha on October 26, 2009, was obtained by fraud. (b) An order setting aside the judgment of this Honourable Court in Suit No. HOW/581/2007, delivered by Honourable Justice N.B. Ukoha on October 26, 2009, which was obtained by fraud.  Alternatively to A & B; An Order setting aside the part of the judgment of Honourable Justice N.B. Ukoha which awarded to the claimant in suit NO.HOW/581/2007 in the sum of N28,516,680.00 (Twenty Eight Million Five Hundred and Sixteen Thousand Six Hundred and Eighty Naira) as special damages for Nigerian treatment and the sum of 108,00.000 (sic) Lakh for her overseas treatment for having been obtained by fraud. (c) An Order for refund of the sum of N62,924,608.00 (Sixty Two Million, Nine Hundred and Twenty- Four Thousand, Six Hundred and Eight Naira) deposited in the Registry of the Court of Appeal, including interest accrued thereon. (d) An Order awarding special damages to the claimants.” (Page 13 of the Records). The summary of Appellants’ claim at the Court below was that some of the receipts tendered by the Respondent (as claimant in Suit No. HOW/581/2007) were procured by fraud/forgery. Therefore, since those receipts which were obtained by fraud/forgery were the basis of the trial Court’s award of special damages in favour of the Respondent, those damages awarded by the trial Court in its judgment should be set aside for the obvious fraud.  The Respondent was served the originating processes of this suit (How/806/2012) and instead of filing a defence to contradict the allegations of the Appellant that some receipts relied upon by the trial Court were obtained by fraud/forgery, the Respondent filed a Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 22nd January, 2018, challenging, in limine, the jurisdiction of the lower Court to adjudicate over the Suit. The ground of the Preliminary Objection was that the issue whether the lower Court’s judgment was based on the issue of fraud/forgery had been determined by the Court of Appeal in its interlocutory ruling (on an interlocutory application filed by the Appellants) in CA/OW/146/2010, on 28/3/2013 and so was defeated by the doctrine of Res Judicata. -" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  MOHAMMED LAWAL GARBA, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  On the 15th March, 2018, the Federal High Court Lower Court, sitting at Lagos, granted the application by way of originating motion of the Respondent for the appointment of an arbitrator for the Appellant which was opposed. Expectedly, the Respondent was dissatisfied with the decision by the Lower Court and so brought this appeal against same on four 4 grounds contained on the Notice of Appeal filed on the 14th May, 2018 from which the four 4 issues are set out for determination in the Appellant’s brief filed on the 16th July, 2018.  The issues are as follows:- “4.1 Whether or not the Learned Trial Court was right to have assumed jurisdiction on the Respondent’s Originating Motion in respect of a dead or expired Memorandum of Understanding MOU - Exhibit MIL1 and Addendum Exhibit MIL2 and appointed an arbitrator for the Appellant on the basis of same from Ground 1 of the Notice of Appeal. 4.2Whether or not an arbitration cause can exist in the face of total death or expiration of an entire agreement from Ground 2 of the Notice of Appeal. 4.3 In the alternative, upon a thorough examination of clause 8 of Exhibit MIL2 Addendum, the Respondent was not stopped from bringing its application for appointment of arbitrator for the Appellant for the purpose of arbitration proceedings aimed at recovering its money from the Appellant after one 1 year from the date of Exhibit MIL2 from Ground 3 of the Notice of Appeal. 4.4 In the alternative, whether upon an examination of Clause 9 of Exhibit MIL2, Exhibit MIL2 does not supersede even the arbitration clause contained in Exhibit MIL1 MOU in the light of inconsistency, ambiguity or conflict between Exhibit MIL1 MOU and Exhibit MIL2 Addendum to the extent that there can be no arbitration between the Appellant and the Respondent from ground 3 of the Notice of Appeal.”  As can be noted easily, against the recognized and accepted practice of brief writing in the appellate Courts, two 2 issues; i.e., Issues 4.3 and 4.4, are indicated to have been formulated from a single ground of appeal: ground 3. The Issues are thereby proliferated being based on a single ground of the appeal, a practice loathed and deprecated by the appellate Courts. See Bamikole v. Oladele 2010 1 NWLR Pt. 1229 483; Nwokearu v. State 2013 16 NWLR Pt. 1380 207; Roda v. FRN 2015 10 NWLR Pt. 1468 427; Iweka v. SCOA 2000 7 NWLR Pt. 664 325 @ 338.  In the Respondent’s brief filed on 2nd October, 2018, deemed on 2nd December, 2019, a preliminary objection to the competence of the appeal was raised and two 2 issues, in the alternative, formulated for decision on the merit of the appeal. While the ground of the objection is that the decision to appoint an arbitrator by the Lower Court is not subject to appeal by virtue of Section 74 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act ACA, 2004, the issues are as follows:- “4.1 Whether an arbitration clause contained in a contract is an agreement independent of the main or primary contract, so that the invalidity of the main or primary contract does not entail the invalidity of the arbitration clause. 4.2 Whether the arbitration agreement between the Respondent and the Appellant is valid and subsisting.”  The Appellant filed a Reply brief on the 17th October, 2018 in response to the objection.  I would deal with the objection by the Respondent first since it goes to question and even attack the competence of the appeal and in consequence, the jurisdiction of the Court to adjudicate over it. The Respondent’s arguments on the objection are that by virtue of the provisions of Section 74 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and the decision of the Court in Bendex Engr. Corp. v. Efficient Petrol Nig. Ltd 2001 8 NWLR Pt. 715 333 and Ogunwale v. Syrian Arab Republic 2002 9 NWLR Pt. 771 127, the decision by the Lower Court to appoint an arbitrator for the Appellant is not subject to appeal. It is contended that the earlier decision by the Court in Nig. Agip Oil Co. Ltd v. Kemmer 2001 8 NWLR Pt. 716 506 @ 510 was distinguished by the Court on the ground that the issue in the appeal was whether the Federal High Court had the jurisdiction to entertain the originating summons filed before it and not on the order for appointment of an arbitrator.  Learned Counsel argues that the right of appeal conferred under Section 241 of the 1999 Constitution would be completely exercised when an appeal was filed by a party after which the appellate Court’s duty would be to refer the parties back to arbitration, in case of appeal on default appointment of an arbitrator, as in the Appellant’s case. According to Counsel, this Court has no jurisdiction to determine any matter that is the subject of arbitration, citing M. v. Lupex v. N. O. C. & S. Ltd 2003 15 NWLR Pt. 844 496; Savoia v. Sonubi 2000 12 NWLR Pt. 682 539 @ 551 and Onward Ent. Ltd. v. MV Matrix 2010 2 NWLR Pt. 1179 531. The case of Environmental Dev. Constr. v. Umara Associates 2000 4 NWLR Pt. 652 293 @ 303 was referred to on the submission that once a party has agreed to arbitration in a contract, the agreement is binding since it has the same effect as if it had been made by a Court order.  The Appellant’s submissions on the objection are that, on the authority of Section 241 1 a of the 1999 Constitution as well as Adigwe v. FRN 2015 ALL FWLR Pt. 805 76 at 88-9 and FRN v. Dairo 2015 NWLR Pt. 776 486 @ 510, a party has the right to appeal against the final decision of a High Court sitting as a Court of first instance, as of right and that any law which purports to deny such a right is unconstitutional and void pursuant to Section 13 of the Constitution. It is also the argument of Learned Counsel for the Appellant that since the appeal is on the issue of jurisdiction, it cannot be defeated by an objection, and reliance was placed on Adigwe v. FRN supra. Section 361 of the Constitution and the case of Omoniyi v. Alabi 2015 ALL FWLR Pt. 774 181 @ 197 on the right of the Appellant to fair hearing were referred to and the Court is urged to hear the appeal on its merit.  Without the need to say more than is necessary on the objection, the law is beyond viable argument that being a constitutional right vested on and guaranteed for a personparty who is dissatisfied with the decision of High Court, sitting as a Court of first instance or trial Court, the right of appeal cannot be taken away or denied by the provision of any other statute or law which is inferior to the Constitution. Any such statute or law which purport to take away or deny a party in the judicial proceedings of a High Court, or indeed any Court established by or pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution, the right of appeal against the decision of such a Court will be inconsistent, in conflict and contradiction with the provisions of Sections 241 1, 242 and 2431 and 2 of the 1999 Constitution as amended and to the extent of its inconsistency with the constitutional provisions, shall be void under Section 13 of the Constitution. See Uwagba v. FRN 2000 13 NWLR Pt. 684 242; Nabaruma v. Offodile 2004 13 NWLR Pt. 891 599, Edjekpo v. Osia 2007 8 NWLR Pt. 1037 635; Min., FCT, M. H. Nig. Ltd 2011 9 NWLR Pt. 1255 272; Nigerian Army v. Yakubu 2013 8 NWLR Pt. 1355 1; Eligwe v. Okpokiri 2015 2 NWLR Pt. 1443 348; Adigwe v. FRN 2015 18 NWLR Pt. 1490 105.  For the provisions of Section 7 4 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act relied on by the Respondent’s Counsel for the objection, they are as follows:- “4 A decision of the Court under Subsections 2 and3 of this section shall not be subject to appeal.” The provisions of Subsection 2 and 3 referred to in the Subsection 4 deal with the procedure for appointment of an arbitratorarbitral Tribunal where no procedure was specifically agreed to by the parties to the arbitration agreement orand where a party fails to act as required under the procedure agreed to by the parties or where the parties or party appointed two 2 arbitrators are unable to agree on the appointment of a 3rd arbitrator or a third party or institution fails to perform the duty imposed on it under the procedure agreed to by the parties.  In the circumstances enumerated in Subsections 2 and 3, the Court is empowered on the application of any of the parties to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, in default.  In the case of Bendex Engr. Ltd. v. Efficient Pet Nig. Ltd supra, the application of the provisions Section 74 to the case was considered by this Court and in the lead judgment of Olagunju, J.C.A., after finding that the provisions did not apply to the facts of the appeal, stated that:- “In conclusion let me say with emphasis that forfeiture of the right of appeal is a serious matter beyond the mere gambit of a preliminary objection as a daunting ploy calculated to stun an opponent as the right of appeal is a constitutional right: see Eze v. Ejelonu 1999 6 NWLR Pt. 605 134, 142-142; and Ibrahim v. Balogun 1999 7 NWLR Pt. 610 254, 266. Without getting involved in doctrinal debate on the constitutional implications of Sub-section 74 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act which is outside the scope of this appeal, I feel impelled to note in passing the approach to the interpretation of legislation on the deprivation of right such as Sub-section 74 of the Act. Particularly instructive is the principle that any legislative provision which seeks to deprive the citizenry of his rights, be they personal or propriety rights, must be interpreted fortissime contra-preferentes, i.e. strict construction against the person relying on the power of deprivation. See Bello v. The Diocesan Synod of Lagos 1973 3 SC 103, 1973 1 All NLR Pt.1 247, 268; Ereku v. Military Governor of Mid-Western State 1974 10 SC 59, 1974 1 All NLR Pt. II 163, 170-171; Peenok Investments Ltd. v. Hotel Presidential Ltd. 1982 12 SC 1, 25-26, 1983 4 NCLR 122; and Din v. Attorney-General of the Federation 1988 4 NWLR Pt. 87 147, 184-185.”  Then, in the case of Nigerian Agip Oil Co. Ltd v. Kemmer supra, this Court again considered the provisions of Section 74 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and unanimously decided that the provisions cannot take or deny the constitutional right of appeal provided for and conferred by the provision Section 241 of the Constitution. Ogebe, J.C.A. then, in the lead judgment at page 517 of the Report, after setting out the entire provisions of Section 7 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, said that:-  “Subsection 4 of this section cannot override the right of appeal conferred by Section 241 of the 1999 Constitution.”  Ikongbeh, J.C.A., who dissented on the issue of jurisdiction of the Federal High Court to entertain the matter leading to the appeal, stated on the effect of Section 74 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, that:- “Mr. Nwosu’s objection to the appeal is predicated on the provisions of Section 74 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, Cap 19, Laws of the Federation, 1990, which makes the decision of the Court to appoint an arbitrator final and not subject to appeal. Mr. Okpoko, S.A.N., however, provided the short answer to this objection when he drew attention to the provisions of Section 241 of the 1999 Constitution, which gives the appellant an unrestricted right of appeal and Section 13, which proclaims the superiority of the constitutionally guaranteed right. If Section 74 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, to the extent that it restricted the right of appeal, had been good law, it ceased to be so when the Constitution came into force. For this reason, I too find no merit in Mr. Nwosu’s objection.”  The position of the law stated by the Court on the legal effect of the provisions of Section 74 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act on the right of appeal conferred and vested by the provisions of Section 241 of the Constitution in these cases, is applicable in all other cases wherein they are sought to be relied on to challenge the competence of an appeal on the ground that there is no such right on the basis of the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.  Again, in the case Ogunwale v. Syrian Arab Republic supra, Chukwama-Eneh, J.C.A., in the lead judgment of the Court, stated on the implication and application of the provisions of Section 74 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act in relation to the Constitutional right of appeal, that:-  “Section 2411 of the 1999 Constitution has [by] the provisions unequivocally conferred on any aggrieved party the right to appeal indeed as of right in circumstances covered by Section 2411ab and c of the 1999 Constitution. The fact that the instant Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1990, Cap. 19, Laws of the Federation is an existing law is of no consequence in challenging any of the rights conferred in Sections 243 and 315 of the Constitution have not abridged the right of appeal given to the appellant under Section 2411 of the 1999 Constitution. Without going flat out to declare the provisions of Section 74 and 34 unconstitutional, it is enough to say here that they cannot override the clear right of appeal conferred on the appellant by Section 2411 of the 1999 Constitution. The bottom line of the matter is that appellant’s right of appeal in this matter has constitutional backing.”  The above position apart, the Court in the aforenamed case has stated the conditions to be met or satisfied for the provisions of Section 74 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act to apply in respect of a decision by a High Court on appointment of an arbitrator. The provisions only render non-appealable proceedings challenging the procedure for appointing arbitrators as stipulated in Subsections 2 and 3. The conditions for the application of the provisions of Section 74 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, were prescribed in the case of Ogunwale v. Syria Arab Republic supra as follows:- 1 a binding, valid, compellable arbitration clause; 2 a dispute capable of being referred to arbitration; and 3 a party must have refused or defaulted to make an appointment. These conditions must co-exist, otherwise Section 74 will not apply to the decision of a High Court appointing an arbitrator and in order to determine whether or not the provisions apply, this Court is to have regard to the grounds of an appeal and the issues raised for decision in the appeal.  The four 4 grounds of this appeal, without particulars are thus:- “GROUND 1 The learned trial judge erred in law when he ruled without jurisdiction on the originating motion based on dead or expired Memorandum of Understanding Exhibit MIL1 and Addendum Exhibit MIL2, filed by the Respondent and appointed an arbitrator for the Appellant on the basis of same. GROUND 2 The learned trial judge erred in law when he held that the arbitration clause still exists where there is no valid agreement between the Appellant and the Respondent and went ahead to appoint an arbitrator for the Appellant on the basis of a dead agreement. GROUND 3 The learned trial judge erred in law when he appointed an arbitrator for the Appellant for the purpose of arbitration proceedings between the Appellant and Respondent, contrary to Clauses 8 and 9 of the Addendum Exhibit MIL2 executed between the parties. GROUND 4 The entire ruling is against the weight of evidence affidavit evidence.”  I have set out the issues raised by the Appellant for determination in the appeal, before now.  Undoubtedly, a calm reading of both the grounds of appeal and the issues submitted for decision, communally show a challenge to the competence of the Lower Court on the basis of the arbitration agreement upon which the appointment of the arbitrator for the Appellant was made by the Lower Court.  The grounds and issues simply question and attack the validity of the arbitration Clauses in the agreements admittedly entered into by the Appellant and the Respondent in respect of the vessel and investment in question.  The grounds and issues do not even pretend to challenge the procedure provided for in the provisions of Section 72 and 3 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act pursuant to which the application was made and on the basis of which the Lower Court’s decision to appoint an arbitrator, was taken by it. Once again, the provisions of Section 72 and 3 merely provide for the situations, circumstances and procedure for the appointment by the Court in default of either an agreement or failure to appoint an arbitrator as provided for in Section 71.  Where an appeal challenges the decision of a Court on the basis of failure to follow or contravention of the procedure for the appointment of a default arbitrator provided for in Section 72 and 3, the provisions of Sub-section 4 may come into effect when the conditions stated in Ogunwale v. Syrian Arab Republic and Bendex Engr. v. Efficient Pet. Nig. Ltd both supra were met for its application.  Since the basis of the appeal is the competence or jurisdiction of the Lower Court to make the appointment of an arbitrator for the Appellant on the basis of the validity of the arbitration clause in their agreement, and not on the procedure set out in Section 72 and 3, the provision of Sub-section 4 is inapplicable. For that reason, the preliminary objection lacks merit, is over-ruled and dismissed.  Now, like I stated earlier, the appeal is predicated on the validity of the arbitration clause and the competence of the Lower Court to make the appointment pursuant thereto, so the germane and crucial issue to decide in the appeal is whether the Lower Court has the requisite jurisdiction and competence to make the appointment of the arbitrator in question. I intend to decide the appeal on the basis of this sole question, taking into account the relevant and material submissions of Counsel thereon, on the authority of, among many other cases, Sha v. Kwan 2000 8 NWLR @ 700, Chabasaya v. Anwasi 2010 NWLR Pt. 1201 Okafor v. Abumofuani 2016 12 NWLR Pt. 1525 117, Governor, Ekiti State v. Olubunmo NWLR Pt. 1551 1 @ 33, by which this Court has the power to determine appeals on the basis of issues it considers proper and crucial.  Appellant’s Submission: The arguments are to the effect that the Lower Court erred in assuming jurisdiction over the application for the appointment of an arbitrator because the agreement, in which the arbitration clause was included, had expired and so was dead. Learned Counsel said the agreement, MOU Exhibit MIL1 was entered into on 5th May, 2011 for two 2 years, by the parties and so it expired by the 4th May, 2015 and since the parties are bound by the terms of their agreement, which the Court cannot re-write for them, there was no live agreement on the basis of which it could have properly assumed jurisdiction to make the appointment. A.G. Rivers State v. Attorney General, Akwa Ibom State 2011 ALL FWLR Pt. 579 1023 @ 1056, Kwam v. Rago 2000 FWLR Pt. 22 1129 @ 1148; The Owners of the MV Lupex v. Nigeria Overseas Chait & Ship Limited 2003 LPELR-SC212000 sic, inter alia, were cited for the submission. It is also submitted that the parties agreed that the arbitration clause in their contract in Exhibit MIL1 was to be revoked and nullified by being superceded by the Exhibit MIL2 and so there was no valid arbitration agreement to base the appointment of an arbitrator in default, by the Lower Court. The case of Joseph v. Kwara State Polytechnic 2014 ALL FWLR 750 1215 @ 1236, Section 169 of the Evidence Act, 2011 and page 1516 of the 9th Edition of the Black’s Law Dictionary on the definition of the word “supercede” were referred to and the Court is urged to adopt the persuasive authority of the American case of Dasher v. RBC Bank USA, No. 13-10257, 2014 WL504704 11th Cir. Feb. 10, 2014.  In summary, the Court is urged to hold that the Lower Court lacks the jurisdiction to make the appointment in the absence of a live agreementcontract between the parties and to allow the appeal.  Respondent’s Submissions: It is submitted that an arbitration clause contained in a contract is separate and independent of the main contract so that the invalidity of the main contract does not entail the invalidity of the arbitration clause. Section 122 of ACA, Article 212 of the Arbitration Rules, 1st Schedule, ACA AR and Tweedale & Tweidale, Arbitration of Commercial Disputes Oxford University Press, 2007 Paragraphs 455 were cited in support.   It is then submitted that the arbitration clause 8 in Exhibit MIL1 is separate and independent of the Exhibits MIL1 and MIL2, which are said to be subsisting and valid on the authority of Attorney General, Rivers State v. Attorney General, Akwa-Ibom supra and Royal Exchange Assurance v. Bentworth Finance Nigeria Limited 1976 11 SC, 107.  Sections 121 and 2 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act were cited and it is maintained that the parties have made an arbitration agreement in both Exhibits MIL1 and MIL2 which they did not revoke and so are bound by it as stated in Africa International Bank Limited v. Int. Dimensional System Limited 2012 ALL FWLR Pt. 656 413 @ 452.  It is the further submission of the Respondent that it is the arbitral Tribunal that has the power to determine the validity of Exhibits MIL1 and MIL2 in relation to the arbitration clause between the parties under the provisions of Section 121 & 2 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act. Heyman & Ors. v. Darwins Limited 1942 AC, 356; Bremer v. Ulkan Schiffbau & Maschinenfabrik v. South Shipping Corporation 1981 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 253 are relied on for the submission and it is contended that the invalidity, death or expiration of the Exhibits MIL1 and MIL2 shall not invalidate the arbitration agreement contained therein.  In conclusion, it is said that the Court lacks the jurisdiction to determine the existence or validity of the contract containing an arbitration clause and urged to dismiss the appeal.  Resolution: I should state, at the onset, that it is not the case of the Appellant that the Lower Court lacks the requisite jurisdiction to adjudicate over the parties or the subject matter of the contract in which they included an arbitration clause.  The law is now very elementary in all Courts of superior record in Nigeria, that the requisite jurisdiction of a Court to entertain and adjudicate over a matter or case is the lifeblood and foundation of all judicial proceeding to be conducted by it, the absence of which or any fundamental defect in which, renders such proceedings completely useless for being legally null, void and of no effect from the beginning to the end. Madukolu v. Nkemdilim 1962 1 ALL FWLR 587 1962 SCNLR, 341 and Oloba v. Akereja 1988 7 SCNJ 56 provide sufficient authority for this position of the law which has remained sacrosanct.  The basis of the appeal, once more, is on the validity of both the contracts; Exhibits MIL1 and MIL2, between the parties and the arbitration clause, which admittedly were both agreed to by the parties and on the basis of which the Lower Court made the appointment of an arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of Section 72 ai of Arbitration and Conciliation Act. Undoubtedly, the parties in both Exhibits MIL1 and MIL2, freely and voluntarily entered into contracts in or by which they chose to include an arbitration clause therein and that being the position, the law is that even though incorporated into the main agreementscontracts; i.e. Exhibits MIL1 and MIL2, the arbitration clause or agreement, is separate and distinct from them such that it survives and remains valid even when the main agreementscontracts come to an end.  Section 122 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act provides that:- “2 For the purposes of Subsection 1 of this section, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract and a decision by the arbitral Tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the validity of the arbitration clause.”  Then Article 212 of the Arbitration Rules says that:- “2. The arbitral Tribunal shall have the power to determine the existence or the validity of the contract of which an arbitration clause forms a part. For the purposes of this article, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract and which provides for arbitration under Rules shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral Tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.” See NNPC v. Clifco Nigeria Limited 2011 2 SCRN 101 2011 4 MJSC, 142, Stabilini Visinoni Limited v. Mallison & Partners Limited 2014 12 NWLR Pt. 1420 134. By the provisions of Section 121 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, it is the arbitration Tribunal and not the Court that should determine the main and primary complaint and challenge to the validity or existence of the arbitration agreement between the parties under which the appointment of an arbitrator was made by the Lower Court for the purposes of Exhibits MIL1 and MIL2. The section provides that:- “121 An arbitral Tribunal shall be competent to rule on questions pertaining to its own jurisdiction and on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement.”  In these circumstances, the Lower Court had the requisite power and authority or jurisdiction to appoint the arbitrator for the Appellant in line with the provisions of Section 72ai of Arbitration and Conciliation Act for the purpose of Exhibits MIL1 and MIL2, admittedly entered into by the parties.  For the aforementioned reasons, the appeal is misconceived, lacking in merit and bound to fail. In consequence wherefore, the appeal is dismissed.  I have observed that the Respondent filed a Respondent’s Notice of Intention to contend that the judgmentdecision of the Lower Court should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied on by that Court.  However, the grounds set out on the Notice and intended to be relied on by the Respondent to urge the Court to affirm the Ruling appointing an arbitrator for the Appellant are that:- “Ground 1: Error in Law The learned trial Judge erred in law when he failed to hold that an arbitration clause contained in a contract is an agreement independent of the main or primary contract, so that the validity of the main or primary contract is not a condition for the Court to enforce the arbitration clause. Particulars of Error 1 The parties have the arbitration clause contained in a Memorandum of Understanding supplemented by an Addendum thereto. 2 The learned trial Judge held that Memorandum of Understanding and the Addendum are non-existent, that is to say they are invalid. 3 The learned trial Judge held in pages 2 and 5 of the Ruling that the main or primary contract in which an arbitration clause is contained has to be valid for the Court to enforce the arbitration clause. Ground 2: Error in Law The learned trial Judge erred in law when he decided on the existence or validity of the Memorandum of Understanding between the parties and the Addendum thereto. Particulars of Error 1 The learned trial Judge held that Memorandum of Understanding and the Addendum are non-existent, that is to say they are invalid. 2 The learned trial Judge lacks the jurisdiction to determine the existence or the validity of the contract of which an arbitration clause forms a part. 3 It is the arbitral Tribunal that has the jurisdiction to determine the existence or the validity of the contract of which an arbitration clause forms a part.”  Clearly, the purport of these grounds, indicated to be errors of law committed by the Lower Court in the Ruling in question, is to challenge or attack the decision in the Ruling, rather than support it on other grounds than relied on by the Lower Court for its decision to make the appointment at the instance of the Respondent. These grounds constitute and are complaints arising out of dissatisfaction of the Respondent with the decision of the Lower Court which if successful, will lead to a reversal of the findings made by that Court on the points of complaints therein. The grounds are therefore grounds of cross-appeal by the Respondent and not grounds which can be relied on to contend that the decisionjudgment of the Lower Court should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied on by it. In this regard, it must be pointed out that there is a difference between a cross-appeal and a Respondent’s Notice to contend that the decision of a Lower Court should be affirmed by an appellate Court on grounds other than those relied on by that Court and that one cannot be a substitute for the other. In addition, a Respondent cannot file a cross-appeal and a Respondent’s notice at the same time in respect of appeal against a decision by a Lower Court. In Williams v. Daily Times of Nigeria Limited 1990 1 NWLR Pt. 124 1 @ 54, a “cross-appeal” was defined as “an appeal by the appellee.” See also Enang v. Archibong 2009 LPELR-8523 CA, Owena Mass Transport Company Limited v. Imafidon 2011 LPELR-4810CA, Akpan v. Bob 2010 17 NWLR Pt. 1223 421, Opara v. D.S. Nigeria Limited 1995 4 NWLR Pt. 390 440, B.C.E. Consulting Engineering v. NNPC 2004 3 NWLR Pt. 859 1. From these definitions, a cross-appeal arises where the parties to a decisionjudgment by a TrialLower Court are both dissatisfied with all or some parts or aspect of it and each filed a notice of appeal against same. The first in time to be filed, will be the Notice of Appeal and the 2nd in time, becomes the Notice of Cross-Appeal, respectively and the common relief to both of them would be to set aside the part or portion of the decisionjudgment of the trialLower Court the party is dissatisfied with on the grounds of the appeal, even though each is separate and independent of the other for the purpose of determination. Igwe v. Kalu 2002 14 NWLR Pt. 787 435, S.B.N. Limited v. M.P.I.E. Limited 2004 6 NWLR Pt. 868 146, Opara v. D.S. Nigeria Limited supra Military Administrator, Benue State v. Ulegede 2001 FWLR Pt. 78 1268 @ 1291, Gabida v. Marcus 2003 FWLR Pt. 169 1451.  Under the Court of Appeal Rules, 2016, Order 91 and 2 provide for a Respondent’s Notice to contend in an appeal before the Court as follows: “1. A Respondent who not having appealed from the decision of the Court below, desires to contend on the appeal that the decision of that Court should be varied, either in any event or in the event of the appeal being allowed in whole or in part, must give notice to that effect, specifying the grounds of that contention and the precise form of the order which he proposes to ask the Court to make, or to make in that event, as the case may be. 2. A Respondent who desires to contend on the appeal that the decision of the Court below should be affirmed on grounds, other than those relied upon by that Court, must give notice to that effect specifying the grounds of that contention.”  The Respondent’s Notice in this appeal is the one provided for in Sub-Rule 2 above and so it is one which not only supports the decisionjudgmentruling by the Lower Court, but also it is supposed to contend that it should be affirmed by the Court on grounds other than those relied on by that Court. The Respondent’s Notice is therefore, not a cross-appeal which essentially seeks to challenge the decisionjudgment of a trialLower Court and prays for its review and reversal. From the grounds set out on the Respondent’s Notice, the Respondent is clearly dissatisfied with and is complaining about the alleged errors of law committed in the Ruling by the Lower Court and which the Court is called upon to reverse.  Learned Counsel for the Appellant is right when he stated at paragraph 7 on page 4 of the Appellant’s Reply brief that by the Respondent’s Notice, the Respondent ‘is trying to set up another appeal other than the Appellant’s appeal before this Court. A cross-appeal cannot be brought by way of a Respondent’s Notice to contend that the decision of a Lower Court be affirmed on grounds other than those relied on it for the decision since the two are in direct opposite and total contradiction of each other.  In these premises, the Respondent’s Notice is misconceived and liable to be struck out.  In the final result, the appeal is dismissed for lacking in merit and the Respondent merits the cost of prosecuting it before the Court. There shall be costs of Three Hundred Thousand Naira N300,000.00 to be paid by the Appellant to the Respondent for the prosecution of the appeal.   JOSEPH SHAGBAOR IKYEGH, J.C.A.:  I am in full agreement with the comprehensive judgment prepared by my learned brother, Mohammed Lawal Garba, J.C.A., Hon. P.J., which I had the benefit of reading in draft.   TIJJANI  ABUBAKAR, J.C.A.:  My learned brother GARBA JCA, granted me the privilege of reading before today the comprehensive leading Judgment just delivered in this appeal. I am in complete agreement, I also endorse the entire reasoning and conclusion and adopt the Judgment as my own. I have nothing extra to add.-end!  " ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  At the Court below, the Applicants (2nd set of Respondents herein) had sought, among others, the following reliefs against the Respondents (now Appellant and the 1st set of the Respondents): a) An order of the Honourable Court restraining the 2nd to 6th Respondents, officers, men and operatives of their respective commands from arresting, harassing or detaining the Applicants at the prompting or instigation of the 1st Respondent, pending the hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice. b) And for such further or other orders as this Hon. Court shall deem fit to make in the circumstances. The grounds for the application, also shown in the supporting affidavit, showed that on 13/8/2004, the 6th Respondent (Mr. C. Imo) Officer-in-charge, Command Surveillance, Owerri, in company of the 5th Respondent (D.P.O. Mgbidi) and other policemen, heavily armed came to the palace to arrest Applicants, but because they did not see Applicants, they dropped invitation letters at the palace (Exhibits A, B, C & D) for Applicants to report at the Police Station - Command office Appellants said that the attempt by 2nd to 6th Respondents to arrest them, resulted in their being trailed by the police, all on the instigation of the 1st Respondent, upon a phantom allegation stated in the Exhibits A to D - namely, threat to life. But on 4/7/2014 Applicants filed Notice of Discontinuance of the Suit and followed up with a Motion on Notice on 10/9/14, seeking the order of Court for leave to Applicants to discontinue the Suit against all the Respondents. That was in reaction to the 1st Respondent’s application to strike out the suit. See pages 65 to 70 of the Records of Appeal. Surprisingly, the Trial Court heard the application to withdraw the suit and refused the same, ordering the parties to proceed with the suit.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  EJEMBI EKO, J.S.C. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  On 16th May, 2006, the Court of Appeal, Lagos Division the lower Court affirmed the decision of the Lagos State High Court the trial Court delivered on 18th July, 1997. The decision of the trial Court was largely on facts.  The Respondent was the Plaintiff at the trial Court; while the Appellant was the Defendant. Between the Appellant and the Respondent: the fact is indubitable that on 29th January, 1985, on the application of the Appellant for term loanoverdraft of N180,000.00, the Respondent granted him the said term loanoverdraft of N180,000.00. The Appellant obtained the said term loanoverdraft of N180,000.00 for \"the processing and development of\" his film business. The Appellant, despite repeated demands for repayment of the loan plus the accrued interest thereon, failed to repay the loan capital and the interest thereon to the Respondent. On 6th December, 1994 the Respondent therefore took out, against the Appellant a suit on a Writ of Summons specially endorsed with the Statement of Claim. The Respondent claimed the following reliefs against the Appellant - a. A declaration that Clause 2 of Memorandum of Deposit of Deed dated 29th January, 1985 made between the Defendant of one part and the Plaintiff is a binding contract upon the Defendant. b. An order compelling the Defendant to execute a legal mortgage in respect of his property situate at No. 22, Akinbaiye Street, !solo in favour of the Plaintiff, and to assign the statutory right of occupancy and deposit the certificate thereto to the Plaintiff as security for a loan of N180,000.00 One Hundred and Eighty Thousand Naira granted by the Plaintiff to the Defendant on 29th January, 1985 and which has accrued with interest to the sum of N844,207.00 as at 17th June, 1992. c. The sum of N844,207.00 being the cumulative principal and interest due to the Plaintiff as at 17th June, 1992 as a result of Banking Facilities term loan overdraft granted at the request and instance of the Defendant for the sum of N180,000.00 One Hundred and Eighty Thousand Naira of the cumulative sum thereof which the Defendant have refused, failed and still refuse, fail and or neglected to pay despite repeated demands. d. 15% interest on overdraft facility at an implied Bank rate from 29th January, 1985 to date of judgment. e. 10% per annum interest at the Court rate from date of judgment until the whole judgment debt together with the interest thereon is fully paid.  The Appellant failed to respond to the suit of the Respondent within the period stipulated by the Rules of the trial Court. The Respondent was then constrained to file, on 8th March, 1996, a motion on Notice under Order 10 Rules 1a & b and Rule 2, and Order 11 Rules 1 & 2 of the High Court of Lagos Civil Procedure Rules, 1972 wherein he prayed for final Judgment against the Appellant in terms of the claims they sought in the suit. This motion gingered the Respondent to file his a 14 paragraph affidavit showing cause why \"he should, as the Defendant, be allowed to defend the action. Paragraphs 4, 5, 6 & 10 of the said affidavit, considered by the trial Court in its decision the subject of this appeal, being germane to this appeal, are herein below reproduced. That is; 4. That it is true that I applied for a loan of N180,000.00 from the Plaintiff but there was no agreement about or payment of any interest whatsoever thereon and the Defendant says that the overdraft loan was interest free. 5. That the purported interest charged on the aforesaid loanoverdraft wasis unilateral on the part of the Plaintiff without the knowledge, consent and agreement of the Defendant and there was no time I was informed before the loanoverdraft was obtained that interest shall be payable on the same. 6. That contrary to the facts deposed to in paragraph 4 of the affidavit in support dated 8th March, 1996 I have no knowledge of any interest accruing and which amounted to N877,207.00 or any sum at all as there was no time statement of account or any advice was sent to me by the Plaintiff... 10. That I am not liable to pay any interest on the aforesaid loan and overdraft of N180,000.00.  The Appellant, as the deponent of the foregoing affidavit, had admitted in paragraph 8 of the affidavit that he did not file any defence to the suit, having been advised by his Counsel that he was \"not entitled to file any defence to this action as of right\".  The learned trial Judge upon considering the statement of claim and the affidavit supporting the motion for judgment vis-a-vis the Appellant's affidavit, part of which I earlier reproduced, found as a fact as follows - \"In the first place, the affidavit of the Defendant does not condescend upon particulars. He admits applying for a loan of N180,000.00 from the Plaintiff but contends that it was interest free. He has exhibited no document to satisfy the Court that the loan was indeed interest free. It was held in the case of Ayansina v. Co-op. Bank Ltd.1994 5 NWLR 347 742 that \"by usual custom of banking, a banker has the right to charge interest at a reasonable rate on overdraft and to debit the interest on the overdrawn account. The Defendant in his affidavit does not dispute the amount or rate of interest charged but contends that no interest was chargeable on the loan. That would be against the normal banking interest practice. The onus is on the Defendant to properly set out the facts on which he relies for his defence in order to satisfy the Court that he ought to be given leave to defend the action. He has not challenged any of the documents exhibited by the Plaintiff. As stated in Macaulay v. NAL Merchant Bank supra a mere general denial by the Defendant that he is not indebted to the Plaintiff is not sufficient to meet the requirement of Order 11 Rules 3 of the Civil Procedure Rules.”  The learned trial Judge, finding that the Appellant the Defendant has not established any satisfactory defence, ruled against granting the leave sought to defend the suit.  The lower Court affirmed the findings of fact by the trial Court that the loanoverdraft the Appellant took from the Respondent was not interest free; that the Appellant's affidavit, intended to show cause why he should be given leave to defend, \"did not condescend on particulars\" and that it did not disclose any defence to the claim of the Respondent. The lower Court further found, in agreement with the trial Court, that the Appellant merely made a sweeping general denial of the averments in the Respondent's supporting affidavit without joining issues with specific averments of the Respondent. This appeal is inter alia against these concurrent findings of fact by the two Courts below.  Issue 1 canvassed by the Appellant is a complaint that the Appellant, from the facts of this case, had established all the factual conditions entitling him to be granted leave by the trial Court to defend the suit. The concurrent findings of fact by the two Courts below are to the effect that he failed to disclose sufficient facts on which the leave sought to defend the suit on the merits will be granted to him. The material question should be; whether the concurrent findings of facts are perverse; that is, whether there are special circumstances that would warrant this Court hearing arguments seeking to disturb the concurrent findings of facts. It is trite that this apex Court will not, on pure question of fact, lightly interfere with concurrent findings of fact: OMETA v. NUNA 1934 11 NLR 18; SERBEH v. KARIKARI 1939 5 WACA 34; KWASI v. TWUM 1953 12 WACA 309; DAWODU v. DANMOLE 1962 1 ALL NLR 702. This judicial policy is informed by established presumption that, on facts, the Courts below are right and the Respondent is prima facie entitled to a judgment dismissing the appeal. The Appellant bears the burden of establishing in what ways he suffered a miscarriage of justice by the concurrent findings of fact.  The Appellant, admittedly averred in paragraph 8 of his affidavit that he filed no defence to the claims of the Respondent having been advised by his Counsel that he was not \"entitled to file any defence to this action as of right\". The fact of his taking the term loanoverdraft of N180,000.00 from the Respondent is indubitable. He admitted that fact. In his affidavit he did not disclose how much he had repaid the Respondent out of his indebtedness. The Appellant, as submitted by the Respondent's Counsel, admitted taking the loan facility but complained that the loan was interest free without adducing any iota of evidence to back up the assertion in order to displace the normal banking custom. The two Courts below found so as a fact. The concurrent finding of fact is not perverse. Whoever desires any Court to give him judgment, as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, has the onus of proving that those facts exist: Sections 1341 and 135 of the Evidence Act, 1990 LFN now Sections 1311 and 132 of the Evidence Act, 2011.  The Appellant's Counsel submits that the trial Court, in giving judgment to the Respondent, gave judgment for interest at compound rate and not a reasonable rate, and that this \"was clearly illegal\". I do not see how this argument can be accommodated under this issue, distilled from grounds 1 and 2 of the Amended Notice of Appeal which complain that there were no facts establishing the conditions for the grant of summary judgment under the relevant Rules of trial Court and that Respondent's Form 917 exhibited to the statement of claim did not show any agreement to pay any interest on the principal loan sum.  The said Form 917, Exhibit A8, gave notice to the Appellant, as the borrower, that \"all usual bank charges and commission and interest would be charged on the loan contrary to the Appellant's averment that he had no knowledge that the loan would attract any interest thereon and that he was not liable to pay any interest on the loan. He executed Form 917, Exhibit A8. The concurrent findings of fact on this, by the two Courts below, are therefore not perverse.  The Respondent having by the processes filed, including the statement of claim, prima facie disclosed a triable issue against the Appellant; it does not avail the Appellant to aver, as he did, that he was, as of right, not entitled to defend the action. I cannot therefore fault the holding of the trial Court, affirmed by the lower Court, that the onus was on the Appellant to properly set out the facts on which he relies for his defence inorder to satisfy the Court that he ought to be given leave to defend the action. The evidence discloses a prima facie case when it is such that, if uncontradicted and if believed, it is not only sufficient to support the case of the Plaintiff against the Defendant; it also entitles the Court to proceed to judgment in favour of the Plaintiff. The totality of the facts in the statement of claim and the other processes, unless sufficiently contradicted by the Appellant, entitle the Respondent to the judgment it got against the Appellant.  The relevant Rules of the trial Court under which it entered judgement, the subject of this appeal, in favour of the Appellant required the Respondent, as the defendant, to show cause why judgment should not be summarily entered for the Respondent against him the Plaintiff having in the processes filed, disclosed prima facie case entitling it to judgment. Showing cause in a summary judgment procedure means the production of satisfactory explanation or excuse by defendant in connection with the action or suit of the plaintiff. In MACAULAY v. NAL MERCHANT BANK LTD 1990 4 NWLR pt. 147 688; 1990 1 NSCC 433 this Court held that, in a summary judgment procedure whereby the defendant is required, upon an affidavit, to show cause why judgment should not be entered against him; the defence he is obligated to disclose is a real defence on the merits and not a sham defence intended only to dribble and frustrate the Court and the plaintiff and thereby delay the disposal of the action.  The case of the Respondent was that the Appellant was owing them a total of N844,207.00 made up of the loan principal of N180,000.00 and interest thereof. The Appellant admitted that he took loan. He, however, insisted inspite of Form 917 Exhibit A8, and the prevailing banking practice or custom, that he did not know that he was obligated to pay interest on the loan. He made only one payment of the agreed monthly instalments vide Exhibit B and stopped servicing the loan thereafter inspite of his undertaking in Exhibit A2 to continue keeping \"a good account performance\", and his further undertaking in Exhibit A1 \"to abide by all - the conditions and terms of repayment\". Exhibit A1 corroborates Exhibit A8 Form 917, that the Appellant was aware of his obligation to repay the loan with interest thereon.  I do not agree with the Appellant that the trial Court misapplied the principle in MACAULAY v. NAL MERCHANT BANK LTD supra. The sham defence he had put up in the affidavit to show cause cannot avail him. Accordingly, I resolve issue 2 in favour of the Respondent.  Issue 3 is all about the complaints over the strictures on the Appellant's counsel by the lower Court. It was submitted, on account of the said strictures, that the Appellant was denied fair hearing and that those observations ultimately resulted in the unfavourable judgment the Appellant had from the lower Court. Those comments on the Appellant's counsel are apparently obiter dictum. Those were the lower Court's reaction to the allegedly unacceptable language used by the Appellant's counsel to describe or refer to the learned lady trial Judge. The party directly aggrieved should have been the Appellant's counsel, and not the Appellant. In the apparent proxy-battle, the learned Appellant's Counsel coming nicodemusly, under the umbrage of the Appellant, his client, has submitted that those comments on the counsel affected the disposition of the lower Court in the final judgment against the Appellant.  An obiter dictum is a statement made in passing which does not form part of the ratio decidendi of the decision appealed. It does not decide the live issue s in the matter: OSHODI v. EYIFUNMI 2000 7 SC 2 145; ORUGBO v. UNA 2002 9 - 10 SC 61; ODUNUKWE v. OFOMATA & ANOR 2010 18 NWLR pt. 1225 404. Not being a ratio decidendi an appeal, generally, cannot lie against an obitum dictum: ODUNUKWE v. OFOMATA supra. Accordingly, grounds 4, 5 & 7, from which issue 3 has been distilled, are incompetent. The incompetence of the said grounds denies issue 3 any legitimacy or competence. Both the issue and its base grounds, being incompetent, are hereby struck out.  In any case, the invitation of the learned Appellant's counsel to this Court to depart from the decision of this Court in GLOBAL TRANSPORT OCEANICO S. A. v. FREE ENTERPRISES NIG LTD 2001 5 NWLR pt. 706 426 at 442 where Kalgo, JSC, posited that it was discourteous for a counsel to use the pronoun \"she\" for a Lady Judge supported the exception taken by the lower Court to the Appellant's counsel's use of the same pronoun \"she\" for the presiding lady trial Judge. I will not press further; the issue being now superflous.  The complaint, articulated in ground 6 of the Amended Notice of Appeal, that the Appellant was denied fair hearing by the trial Court because, on the day the motion for judgment was heard, the Appellant's counsel was arguing another motion elsewhere in another Court, the trial Court should have adjourned the matter to another date to give the Appellant an opportunity to offer his final address instead of foreclosing that right by the trial Court adjourning the matter for RulingJudgment. The lower Court approved of what the trial Court did. The Appellant's counsel had disingenuously stretched issue 4, arising from ground 6 of the Amended Notice of Appeal, to issue 3. He submitted that flowing from issue 3, the Appellant could not be said to have received fair hearing by the Court of Appeal. How? If I may ask. The lower Court, apart from affirming what the trial Court did earlier in its proceedings, did not share or partake in the decision of the trial Court in relation to the adjournment the subject of this appeal.  The grant or refusal to grant adjournment is a matter of discretion and it depends on the facts and circumstances of each case: ODUSOTE v. ODUSOTE 1971 1 NWLR 228; N.P.A v. CONSTRUZIONI G.F. COGEFAR SPA 1974 12 SC 81 at 91; SALU v. EGEIBON 1994 6 NWLR pt. 348 23. No Court sits at the convenience of either a party or his counsel, no matter his status or their imagination of their status. I agree with the Appellant's Counsel that this Court, in NDUKAUBA v. KOLOMO 2005 ALL FWLR pt. 248 1602, held that at the close of the case and in accordance with the relevant rules, a party must have the same right as given to his adversary to offer his final address or summation. That is not the issue here.  On 14th May, 1997 the counsel for respective parties were in Court and agreed with the Registrar of the trial Court that the matter be heard on 7th July, 1997. But at the resumed hearing on 7th July, 1997 the Appellant's counsel was absent without any courtesy or excuse to either the Court or the Counsel for the PlaintiffRespondent. The trial Court, however, graciously stood the matter down for hearing later that day. At 12.10 pm when it resumed hearing, the counsel for the defendantAppellant was still absent, notwithstanding the indulgence of the trial Court to stand down and wait for him. The appellant had the notice of the hearing of the matter fixed for 7th July, 1997. He waived his right to be heard on the motion for summary judgment. He cannot therefore be heard to say that he was not given an opportunity to present his client's case. He does not deny that he was aware of the adjourned date.  A party given or provided an opportunity to present his case, who failed to utilise the opportunity, cannot complain that he was denied the opportunity to be heard. Fair hearing, within the context of audi alteram partem, means only that the Court should give equal opportunity to both sides to present their respective cases: CHAMI v. U.B.A PLC 2010 2 3 SC pt. II    92 at 95. It does not mean, as audaciously submitted and expected by the Appellant's counsel, that beyond providing the parties an equal opportunity to present their cases that one of the parties or his counsel could hold the Court and his adversary to ransom and insist that the Court sit at his convenience. Rule 16 of the Rules of Professional Conduct for Legal Practitioners, 2007, which enjoins a lawyer to competently represent his client in Court, also directs that the lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him. Rules 311 and 30 of the same Rules of Conduct obligated the lawyer to always treat the Court with respect, dignity and honour and not to \"do any act or conduct himself in any manner that may obstruct, delay or adversely affect the administration of justice.\"  The unwholesome antecedents of the counsel for the Appellant at the trial Court, as listed in the lead judgment of the lower Court Denton-West, JCA and the minutes of the trial, clearly suggest a conduct unbecoming of the said counsel at the trial Court. He was nonetheless accommodated with maturity by the learned trial Judge. The polite resentment of this conduct was expressed in the concurring judgment of Garba, JCA, at page 231 of the record, to the effect that the learned counsel for the defendant Appellant though was quite aware, since 14th May, 1997, that the matter was set down for hearing on 7th July, 1997, still absented himself from the hearing on the ground that he was busy arguing another motion before another Court on the date and time. With ignominy therefore, the complaint and submissions that the motion was fixed for mention on the 7797 are unserious and therefore untenable - - -. Judicial commonsense, logic and normal or usual course of proceedings would not accept such a puerile contention.  I will also dismiss, with ignominy, the puerile contention that the trial Court denied the Appellant fair hearing. Counsel for the defendant Appellant having at the trial Court without excuse, opted out of the hearing fixed to take place on 7th July, 1997, cannot be heard to complain that his client was denied fair hearing: ADEYEMI v. LAN & BAKER 2000 7 NWLR pt. 663 33; OMO v. J. S. C 2000 12 NWLR PT. 682 444; MMS v. OTEJU 2005 5 SCpt. 1 55; CHAMI v. U. B. A PLC 2010 supra.  On the whole, I find no substance in this appeal on all the issues canvassed. Accordingly, the appeal is hereby dismissed in its entirety. The decision of the trial Court as affirmed by the lower Court on 16th May, 2006 in the appeal No. CAL492001 is hereby further affirmed. Costs at N500,000.00 shall be paid to the Respondent by the Appellant.   IBRAHIM TANKO MUHAMMAD, AG. C.J.N.: My Learned brother, Eko, JSC, has afforded me an opportunity of reading before now the judgment just delivered. I am in agreement with my lord that the appeal is lacking in merit and ought to have been dismissed. I too, hereby dismiss the appeal. I abide by all orders made in the leading judgment including the one on costs.   AMINA ADAMU AUGIE, J.S.C.:  I had a preview of the lead Judgment just delivered by my Learned brother, Eko JSC, and I agree with his reasoning and conclusion.  My learned brother addressed the Issues raised by the parties for and against their respective positions meticulously, and I see no reason to belabour the point. Suffice it to say that I adopt what he said and it is on that premise that I will also dismiss this Appeal and abide by the Order on costs. The Appeal is hereby dismissed.   PAUL ADAMU GALUMJE, J.S.C.:  I have had the privilege of reading in draft, the judgment just delivered by my Learned brother, Ejembi Eko, JSC and I entirely agree with the reasoning contained therein and the conclusion arrived thereat. Where there is no express agreement as to the rate of interest payable, the bank is entitled to charge interest rate on the basis that there is an established custom to that effect. See Barclays Bank of Nigeria Ltd v. Alhaji Maiwada Abubakar 197710 SC.13. Learned Counsel for the Appellant is wrong when he submitted that the terminal loan of N180,000.00 granted to the Appellant was interest free. The Respondent is established with the sole aim of doing business in order to earn profit. It will be playing the role of Father Christmas if it dishes out loan without charging interest.  My Learned brother has as usual thoroughly considered all the issues submitted for determination of this appeal in such a way that any further comment by me will result in repetition. I find no merit in this appeal. Accordingly, same shall be and it is hereby dismissed. I endorse all the consequential orders made in the lead judgment, including order as to costs.   UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI, J.S.C.: I have had a preview of the judgment of my learned brother, Ejembi Eko, JSC and I completely lend my support to the reasons and conclusions arrived at therein.  The Appellant was given a term loan of N180,000.00 in 1985 and despite repeated demands by the Respondent, he failed to liquidate same. The Appellant was sued on 6121994 and having failed to file his defence, judgment was entered against the Appellant. Interesting is the fact that he also lost at the lower Court and my learned brother has re-affirmed the concurrent decisions of the Courts below. The Appellant having collected the loan from the Respondent without denial, cannot now on technical grounds of fair hearing be let off the noose on ground of denial of fair hearing. Per SANUSI, JSC in DARMA v. ECO BANK 2017 LPELR-41663 SC, in a similar scenario with the present appeal encapsulated the principles of fair hearing as provided in the Constitution. The time honoured principle of fair hearing has, for time immemorial, been entrenched in our laws. The cardinal principle of fair hearing are twofold s and are expressed in the following maxims a \"Audi alteram Partem\" meaning that the Judge before whom the complaint or grouse is taken must hear the two parties to the dispute, and b \"Nemo Judex in cause\" meaning that there should be no evidence of bias, so that one should not be a Judge in one's own cause. The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended, had entrenched by its Section 36, the principle of fair hearing under those provisions which clearly give the criteria of fair hearing which are as follows:-  i That the Court shall hear both sides to a case and also must consider the case of both parties too.  ii That the Court must also hear all material issues before reaching its decision which may be prejudicial to any party in the case.  iii The Court must give equal treatment opportunity to all the Parties.  iv That the proceedings shall be held in public and all concerned shall have access and be informed of such place of public hearing.  v In every material decision of the case, Justice must be seen to have been manifestly done and not merely done.  The Appellant who has slept over his case cannot complain of denial of fair hearing. Fair hearing is a 2 way traffic and for the benefit of the parties involved in the contest and not only for one. He who comes to equity must have clean hands.  It is on record that the Respondent has made several demands on the Appellant for the principal and interest on the loan facility but all to no avail before this suit was instituted. Generally, a debt is repayable either on demand, or on notice given or upon any other condition agreed upon by the parties. It is also an implied term in the relationship between a banker and his customer that there should be no right of action for the repayment of an overdraft until there has been a demand or notice given. The cause of action does not arise until there has been a demand made or notice given. When therefore there is no specific date agreed upon for the repayment of an overdraft, a demand should be made or notice given. In other words, a cause of action on an unpaid overdraft is not deemed to accrue where no specific date for payment is agreed upon until there has been a demand made or notice given. See Per IGUH, JSC inISHOLA v. SOCIETE GENERALE BANK NIG LTD 1997 LPELR-1547SC. The Appellant should rather settle his indebtedness to the Respondent than clinging to delay tactics and technicalities.  Besides, I have nothing to do but stand with the concurrent decisions of the two Courts below. It is trite that where there are concurrent findings of a trial Court and the Court of Appeal, then unless the findings are –  i found to be perverse; or  ii not supported by the evidence; or  iii reached as a result of a wrong approach to the evidence; or  iv a result of a wrong application of a principle of substantive law or procedure,  this Court, even if disposed to come to a different conclusion upon the printed evidence, cannot do so.  I therefore agree with the decision and reasons reached by my learned brother, Ejembi Eko, JSC and fully abide with the order as to costs.  The appeal is dismissed.-end!  " ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  JAMES SHEHU ABIRIYI, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  This is an appeal against the judgment delivered on 25th May, 2016 in the High Court of Taraba State holden at Jalingo where the Appellant was tried, convicted and sentenced to a prison term of seven 7 years for the offence of rape contrary to Section 283 of the Penal Code.  In a resume, the facts of the case for the prosecution include the following: The PW1 and PW3 were sent on an errand by the mother of the PW3. Somewhere on their way they stopped. The Appellant came on a motorcycle, picked the PW3, held her with one hand and drove away with her. He drove around with her despite her cries. At a point, he stopped and somebody came with a machete and asked why she was crying. The Appellant told the person to forget about her. Then the Appellant took her behind a filling station. Appellant pushed her to the ground. Appellant removed his trousers. Appellant removed her pant. The Appellant brought out his penis and had an illicit connection with the PW3.  Blood started coming out from PW3’s vagina and she was crying.  The Appellant then took her and put her on the motorcycle, pushed her off by a roundabout when he saw PW3’s mother PW2. The Appellant threw four hundred Naira N400 on her and rode off.  PW3’s mother and those with her lifted the PW3 from the ground and took her to the police station.  The Appellant denied having illicit connection with the PW3. According to him, he was requested to drop the PW3 at her house with his motorcycle. Her house was described to him. He drove past the house. The PW3 told him to take her back to her boy friend who he understood was where he picked her from. He noticed one Manasseh who earlier wanted to snatch PW3 in a vehicle coming. So he took another road and returned to the place where he picked the PW3.  He made a statement to the police at the Police Station Zing. At the “CID Jalingo” he made another statement. He did not confess to committing the offence. The signature on Exhibit PA1 is not his signature but the one on Exhibit B2 is his signature.  The Court below convicted the Appellant on the evidence led after considering the prosecution’s case and the defence of the Appellant.  The Appellant on the 28th June, 2016, filed an initial notice of appeal challenging the conviction and sentence. The notice of appeal contained ten grounds of appeal. By the order of this Court, made on 13th June, 2018, the Appellant amended the notice of appeal. The amended notice of appeal filed on the 10th November, 2017 was deemed duly filed and served on 13th June, 2018. The amended notice of appeal contains ten 10 grounds of appeal.  In an amended Appellant’s Brief of Argument filed 6th March, 2019 and deemed duly filed and served on 12th March 2019, the Appellant presented the following seven issues for determination from the ten grounds of appeal: 1. Whether the failure of the Respondent to reproduce PW4 for further cross-examination does not amount to breach of the right to fair hearing of the Appellant? Distilled from Ground one. 2. Whether from the facts and circumstances before the Honourable lower Court, the Respondent could be said to have proved beyond reasonable doubt that PW3 was a 13 year old minor and if the answer is in affirmative, whether the trial Court complied with Section 209 1 and 3 of the Evidence Act, 2011 before relying on her piece of evidence to convict the Appellant? Distilled from Grounds 2 and 3. 3. Whether the Honourable lower Court was not in error when it accorded Exhibit PA1 so much probative value despite the denial put forward by the Appellant as to the signature thereon and the issue relating to not reading of the Exhibit in the open Court, failure to call the superior officer before whom the said statement was made, the riotous nature of the Exhibit with Exhibit B2 and the fact that same was not made in the presence of the counsel to the Appellant? Formulated from Grounds 5, 6, and 7. 4. Whether pieces of evidence emanating from PW1, PW2, DW1, DW2 read together with Exhibits PA1, PA2, B1 and B2 were complimentary and thus capable of corroborating the evidence of PW3? Formulated from Ground 8. 5. Whether proof of locus criminis of the offence of rape is not a fact in issue capable of having a fatal effect on the case of the prosecution in event of same not been proved? Formulated from Ground 9. 6. Whether the failure of the Honourable trial Court to consider some salient issues raised by the Appellant did not amount to breach of his right to fair hearing? Formulated from Ground 10. 7. Whether the Honourable lower Court can be said to have properly evaluated the evidence before arriving at the conclusion of the verdict of guilt against the Appellant? Formulated from Grounds 4 and 11.  In an amended Respondent’s Brief of Argument filed on 3rd June, 2019 but deemed duly filed and served on 18th September, 2019, the Respondent presented the following three issues for determination: ISSUE ONE Whether the Respondent has proved the offence of rape punishable under Section 283 of the Penal Code against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt Distilled from grounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the grounds of appeal. ISSUE TWO Whether the Court below was right when it relied on the evidence of the prosecutrix PW3, PW1, PW2, Exhibits PA1 and 81 with the surrounding circumstances in convicting and sentenced the appellant to 7 years imprisonment for the offence of rape punishable under Section 283 of the Penal Code Distilled from grounds 5, 6 and 7 of the grounds of appeal. ISSUE THREE Whether the Court below failed to accord the appellant right to fair hearing as the prosecution was unable to recalled sic PW4 for further cross-examination Distilled from grounds 1, and 3 of the grounds of appeal.  Appellant filed a reply brief on 6th June,’ 2019, deemed duly filed and served 18919.  This appeal in my view can be determined on the following two issues: 1. Whether the prosecution proved the offence of rape contrary to Section 283 of the Penal Code against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt. 2. Whether the Court below failed to accord the Appellant his right to fair hearing.  Learned counsel for the Appellant pointed out that the Appellant applied for the recall of all six witnesses called by the Respondent and all other witnesses were recalled except PW4 who recorded Exhibit PA1 relied upon by the Court below.  It was submitted that the failure to recall the PW4 by the Respondent for further cross-examination and the reliance of the Court below on Exhibit PA1 constituted a miscarriage of justice and amounted to a breach of fair hearing against the Appellant. It was further submitted that the failure to recall the PW4 amounted to with holding of evidence. The Court was referred to Section 167’ of the Evidence Act 2011.  It was submitted that the failure to recall PW4 was fatal to the case of the Respondent and the Court below erred when it relied on the evidence of PW4 particularly Exhibit PA1 tendered through him.  Only PW2 and PW3 the mother and daughter respectively testified to the age of the PW3, it was pointed out. The PW2 the mother, it was contended, turned somersault and said that she did not know the age of the PW3 the daughter. No birth certificate was tendered, it was submitted. The Court was referred to the evidence of the PW3 where she stated thus: “I am 13 years old. It is not 5 years from the date of betrothal to the date of the incident. I will not know the number of years in between. It has been long so I cannot remember. I am 14 years now...” Page 106 of the record.  The Court was also referred to page 34 of the record where the PW3 stated thus: “... He has only paid the dowry long time ago. I was 12 years old then ... It may be up to 5 years since Chindo paid my dowry ...”  All the Court below did it was contended, was to believe the testimony of PW2 as to the age of PW3 without more even in view of the contradicting testimonies of PW2 and PW3. The Court was referred to pages 201 and 208 of the record of appeal.  It was submitted, the only conclusion is that the PW3 was about 17 years old at the time of the alleged rape and not a minor incapable of giving consent. This, it was submitted, was fatal to the case of the Respondent.  Assuming without conceding that the PW3 was indeed a minor at the time of the alleged rape, the Court below, it was argued did not comply with Section 2091 and 3 of the Evidence Act. The Court was referred to Okon & Ors vs. The State 1988 LPELR-2472 Pg. 16 - 17 and Dagayya vs. The State 2006 LPELR-912 PP. 42 - 43.  The evidence of PW3, it was submitted, was not corroborated, and the Court below wrongly convicted the Appellant on the uncorroborated evidence of PW3 who the Respondent presented as a minor.  It was submitted that the evidence PW1, PW2, DW1, DW2 read together with Exhibits PA1, PA2, B1 and B2 are so contradictory in material facts that it cannot be said they are complementary as to corroborate the evidence of PW3.  It was submitted that the failure to read the confessional statement of the Appellant in open Court was fatal to the case of the Respondent.  It was submitted that Exhibit PA1 was at variance with Exhibit B1, both statements of the Appellant and the Court below picked Exhibit PA1.  It was also pointed out that the Appellant denied the signature on Exhibit PA1.  It was further pointed out that the statements of the Appellant were recorded by the police in the absence of his lawyer.  It was submitted that the Court below ought not to have relied on the statement in convicting the Appellant. The Court was referred to Owhoruke vs. Commissioner of Police 2015 LPELR-24820 PP. 22 - 23.  The Respondent, it was submitted failed to prove the locus criminis, that is, where the alleged rape took place and this was fatal to its case. The Court was referred to Ibrahim vs. The State 2015 4 SCM 184 at 208 and Ezekwe vs. The State 2018 LPELR-44392.  Copious authorities were cited by Appellant’s counsel on good judgments and fair hearing.  Learned Director of Public Prosecutions Taraba State for the Respondent submitted that in criminal prosecutions, the burden of proof lies squarely on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused person beyond reasonable doubt and referred the Court to Igabele vs. The State 2007 2 NCC 125, Nnajiofor vs. People of Lagos State 2015 LPELR-24666 CA; Abdullahi vs. The State 2008 17 NWLR Pt. 1115 203, Oseni vs. The State 2012 208 LRCN 153 and Section 1351 of the Evidence Act.  He submitted that proof beyond reasonable doubt entails establishing the ingredients of the offence. The Court was referred to Adonike vs. The State 2015 Vol. II NCC 97 at 105 - 106.  It was submitted that from the evidence of PW2 - PW6, it can be inferred that the Appellant raped the PW3.  PW2, it was submitted, under cross-examination stated that PW3 was under 13 years old.  It was submitted that by virtue of Section 2821 of the Penal Code, a girl under the age of 14 years is incapable of giving consent to sexual intercourse. The Court was referred to Natsaha vs. The State 2017 Vol. 9 CAC 309 at 313 and Shuaibu vs. Kano State 2016 LPELR-40011 SC.  The PW3, it was pointed out, was not the wife of the Appellant.  From the evidence adduced by the Respondent, it can be inferred that the Appellant intended to rape the PW3, it was submitted.  It was submitted that evidence of penetration came from the PW3 the victim. The Court was referred to page 32 of the record. The Appellant, it was submitted, in his statement to the police Exhibit PA1 stated that at the time he was having the illicit connection with the PW3, she was not crying. It was submitted that penetration is the most essential ingredient of the offence of rape. The Court was referred again to’ Natsaha vs. The State supra, Iko vs. The State 2001 6 MJSC 1 and Musa vs. The State 2013 Vol. 221 Pt. 2 LRCN 186 at 191.  It was submitted that the prosecution had proved the offence of rape beyond reasonable doubt.  It was submitted that there were other facts outside the confessional statement of the Appellant which showed that the confessional statement Exhibit PA1 was true. Exhibit PA1, it was submitted, was tendered and admitted without objection and is therefore good evidence. We were referred to Egharevba vs. The State 2016 258 LRCN 187 at 195. It was submitted that the Appellant cannot challenge the confessional statement Exhibit PA1 on appeal having failed to do so when it was tendered in evidence.  Learned counsel for the Respondent pointed out that the Appellant denied the signature on Exhibit PA1 but argued that the Appellant did not tender any document showing his signature. It was submitted that failure to do so was fatal to the case of the Appellant. The Court was referred to’ Yongo vs. COP 1992 8 NWLR Pt. 257 4.  It was submitted that Section 2091 of the Evidence Act was complied with because the PW3 affirmed before she gave evidence.  It was submitted that the Respondent did not deliberately fail to recall the PW4 through whom Exhibit PA1 was tendered and admitted without objection. He was cross-examined. It was submitted that the inability of the Respondent to recall the PW4 for further cross-examination did not adversely affect the fairness or otherwise of its case and did not occasion a miscarriage of justice. The Court was referred to Jones vs. COP 1960 FSC 38.  It was submitted that Appellant was charged with committing the offence at Zing. Therefore, it did not matter whether it was in a room or behind a filling station provided the two places are in’ Zing.  The Appellant’s Reply Brief introduced new arguments, both on the facts and law. This is not permitted under the Rules of this Court. See Order 19 Rule 51 of the Court of Appeal Rules 2016 which permits of filing a reply brief which shall deal with new points arising from the Respondent’s brief. As the Appellant’s Reply Brief has done violence to the Rules of the Court, I will discountenance it.  The position of the law which hardly requires the citing of legal authorities is that where the commission of a crime is in issue the allegation must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The burden of proof is on the prosecution and it never shifts. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond shadow of doubt or proof to the hilt or proof beyond all iota of doubt. Thus if the evidence adduced by the prosecution is so strong against an accused person as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour, the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt. See Section 36 5 of the 1999 Constitution FRN which provides that every person who is charged with a Criminal Offence shall be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty. See also Agbo vs. The State 2006 6 NWLR Pt. 977 545, Igabele vs. The State 2006 6 NWLR Pt. 975 100, Michael vs. The State 2008 13 NWLR Pt. 1104 361, Orisa vs The State 2018 LPELR-43896 SC page 9 - 10, Darlinton vs. FRN 2018 LPELR-43850 SC and The State vs. Fadezi 2018 LPELR-44731.  At common law, rape is the unlawful sexual intercourse committed by a man with a woman not his wife through force and against her will. The offence is incomplete if there is no penetration of the person into the vagina. Also a husband cannot be convicted of raping his wife. See Black’s Law 2014 Edition by Bryan A. Garner.  For the conviction of the Appellant to be sustained there must be credible evidence that the Appellant had sexual intercourse with the PW3 against her will; 2 without her consent; 3 with her consent when her consent had been obtained by putting her in fear of death or of hurt; 4 with her consent, when the man knows that he was not her husband and that her consent was given because she believed that he was another man to whom she was or believed herself to be lawfully married; 5 with or without her consent, when she was under fourteen years of age or of unsound mind. See Section 282 of the Penal Code and Mamuda vs. The State 2019 LPELR-46343 SC page 15.  Evidence of corroboration of the evidence of the victim in a rape case is not required as a matter of law. However it is desirable that the evidence of the complainant should be strengthened by other evidence implicating the accused person in some material particular. It is not the law however that an accused person in a charge of rape cannot be convicted on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. See Ogunbayo vs. The State 2007 8 NWLR Pt. 1035 157 and Iko vs. The State 2001 14 NWLR Pt. 732 221.  On the 31st January, 2013, PW4 testified and was cross-examined by the learned counsel for the Appellant. When the learned counsel for the Appellant asked for the recall of all five witnesses called by the Respondent in proof of the alleged offence against the Appellant, several efforts were made to get the PW4 back to Court for the further cross-examination. Nothing came out of these efforts. According to learned counsel for the Respondent, the matter lingered on for about ten months after several adjournments and apparently both counsel and the Court agreed that progress be made by the Appellant commencing his defence. See pages 116 and 117 of the record. As learned counsel for the Respondent rightly pointed out the reason for the inability to recall the PW4 was that he was no longer serving in Jalingo, Taraba State. He had been transferred to Mubi in Adamawa State. From Mubi, he had been transferred somewhere else. See page 113 of the record. It is not surprising therefore that the Court agreed with the parties that the matter proceeds to defence. The grouse of the Appellant is that the Court below relied on the evidence tendered through the PW4 since he could not be recalled for further cross-examination. The Court below in my view rightly relied on that evidence because the cautionary statement of the Appellant tendered through the PW4 was tendered and the Appellant’s counsel said he had no objection. It was admitted and marked Exhibit PA1 by the Court below. After the PW4 had testified he was cross-examined at length by learned counsel for the Appellant. The Court below would have erred if it disregarded the evidence tendered through the PW4 merely because the PW4 could not be recalled for further cross-examination.  I have noticed that on 26th February, 2014, when the Respondent’s counsel requested that recall of PW4 be dispensed with to avoid further delay, Appellant’s counsel made no effort to explain why the further cross-examination of the witness was necessary. He merely retorted thus: “We do not intend to dispense with the cross examination of this witness but we shall concede to an adjournment.”  But the witness had been cross-examined as pointed earlier, at length. He was being recalled for further cross examination.  For the purpose of emphasis, I repeat that the Court below rightly relied on Exhibit PA1 which was tendered and admitted through PW4 without any objection.  PW2 both in evidence in Chief and under cross-examination maintained that the PW3 her daughter was 13 years old. The fact that she said under cross-examination that she could only count years but could not know or remember the date of birth of PW3 did not detract from her evidence that the PW3 was 13 years old. PW2 being the mother of the PW3 was the best witness in respect of PW3’s age among the witnesses called by the Respondent.  Learned counsel for the Appellant is therefore wrong in turning to the evidence of PW3 and a couple of other witnesses to look for evidence of the age of the PW3. The Court below therefore rightly relied on the evidence of the PW2 that the PW3, the complainant was 13 years old at the time of the alleged rape.  Although the PW3 gave evidence on affirmation contrary to Section 2091 of the Evidence Act; I do not agree with learned counsel for the Appellant that the evidence of the PW3 was not corroborated as required under Sub-section 3.  Learned counsel for the Appellant contended that evidence of PW1, PW2, DW1 and DW2 read together with Exhibits PA1, PA2, B1 and B2 were contradictory without the least effort to point out even one such contradiction. It is not enough merely to mouth that there are contradictions without showing such contradictions and the nature whether material or mere inconsistencies.  Learned counsel for the Appellant consented to the document Exhibit PA1 being taken as a read. See page 38 of the record of appeal where the Court stated thus: “With consent of both learned counsel, the document sic are taken as duly read in Court.”  It is clear from the foregoing that the Appellant is shedding Crocodile tears because the document was taken as read with his consent. In the circumstances, the Court will ignore that complaint.  Again, the Appellant is complaining before this Court that the Superior Police Officer before whom the Appellant was taken after Exhibit PA1 was recorded was not called as a witness. The Appellant did not object to the admission of Exhibit PA1 on the ground that the Superior Police Officer before whom he was taken was not called as a witness; or on any other ground. This complaint also has no basis.  Another complaint by the Appellant is that there is contradiction between evidence of PW3 and Exhibit PA1. Exhibit PA1 was not made by the PW3 but by the Appellant. So that argument is neither here nor there. Again without pointing out the contradictions in Exhibits PA1 and B2 which were not made by any of the Respondent’s witnesses, the complaint about the contradictions in the two exhibits is also neither here nor there.  When Exhibit PA1 was sought to be tendered, the learned counsel for the Appellant did not claim that the signature on it was not that of the Appellant. The denial of the signature on Exhibit PA1 by the Appellant as his own at the conclusion of his defence was merely an after-thought. The Court below rightly disregarded the denial.  Furthermore, the learned counsel for the Appellant took a swipe at the Court below for relying on Exhibit PA1 which was recorded in the absence of Appellant’s counsellawyer. I cannot fault the Court below for doing so because as stated severally above the said Exhibit PA1 was tendered and admitted without any objection. Learned counsel for the Appellant did not object to the admission of the Exhibit on the ground that it was recorded in the absence of Appellant’s counsel.  It is a cardinal rule of evidence in civil and criminal cases that an objection to the admissibility of document sought by a party to be tendered in evidence must be taken when the document is offered in evidence. Where objection has not been raised by the opposing party to the reception of the document in evidence, such objection cannot afterwards be raised on appeal unless by law the document is rendered inadmissible. SeeEtim & Ors vs. Ekpe & Anor 1983 3 SC 12 at 36 - 38. The Appellant has not shown that Exhibit PA1 is inadmissible in law. Having not objected to its being admitted in evidence, he cannot afterwards be heard to complain so profusely about its admission on appeal.  Learned counsel for the Appellant asserted without more that there were two contradictory places where the alleged rape took place. Learned counsel did not point out the two contradictory places. From the charge, the Appellant was alleged to have committed the alleged rape at Zing in Zing Local Government Area. Learned counsel for the Appellant did not show which other place any of the witnesses or a witness mentioned as the place the alleged offence took place.  The PW3 in her testimony in Court stated as follows: “Then another man called Manasseh came holding my skirt from behind while the machine was moving - 1st Accused held me with one hand and drove the machine with one hand. He was running while I was crying, he passed near our house and I was still shouting. He took me behind the hospital. He started beating me saying because that since I am crying he will call other people to come and molest me. He said I should climb the machine or he will beat me. I climbed the machine. He took me to the cemetery in Dan Lappa. I was crying when another person came holding a matchet. That person asked him why I was crying he told the man to forget about me. From there he took me behind a filing station. He pushed me on the ground; he removed his trousers, he removed my pant. He brought his penis, he pushed his penis into my virgina private part. He forcefully penetrated into my private part virgina. Blood started coming out of my private part and I was crying. After he finished he took me and put me on top of the motorcycle. When he saw my mother around the roundabout he pushed me off the motorcycle. My mother is Suzana Shombi. He just threw some money N400 on me and ran off. Then my mother came and took me up from the ground. My mother was not alone. There were other people there. When they lifted me from the ground they took me to the police station. I was asked as to what happened. I told them i.e. narrated the story.”  The evidence of PW3 reproduced extensively above was strengthened by the evidence of PW1 and PW2 as well as Exhibit PA1 the statement of the Appellant to the police. PW1 saw when the Appellant dropped the PW3 and four hundred Naira N400 from his motorcycle. He saw her crying and blood was coming out according to him from her vagina. So they took her to the police station. The following day, the police took her to the general hospital.  PW2 also saw the Appellant forcefully drop the PW3 at the roundabout from his motorcycle. The PW3 was bleeding. They proceeded to the police station. The next day they took the PW3 to the general hospital. Under cross-examination, the PW2 said the blood was on PW3’s pant and skirt so, it could not have been from the beating only.  Under cross-examination, the PW3 said they spent about two 2 minutes at the filling station. That the Appellant penetrated her rather quickly that was why she bled and also cried. She maintained that it was the Appellant who picked her from the ground after the incident and placed her on the motorcycle.  In Exhibit PA1, the Appellant admitted having sexual intercourse with the PW3. Exhibit PA1 reproduced in part reads as follows: “I took her to Tudun Wada Ward. From there to Lapo and we came to a Petrol Filling Station which I cannot remember the name and took Rita to Garba’s room near the Filling Station where I lay her on a mattress and I had sexual intercourse with her.”  On the evidence of PW2, the PW3 was under fourteen years. According to the PW2, the PW3 was 13 years at the time of the alleged rape. The Court below was therefore on firm ground when it found that the sexual intercourse which the Appellant admitted having with the PW3 amounted to rape. Issue 1 is therefore resolved against the Appellant and in favour of the Respondent.  As I pointed out earlier, learned counsel for the Appellant cited copious authorities on what amounts to a good judgment without any effort to show that the judgment of the Court below was bad and why. That was a mere academic exercise. The Appellant did not also show that he was not given fair hearing.  Issue 2 is also resolved against the Appellant and in favour of the Respondent.  Both issues having been resolved against the Appellant and in favour of the Respondent, this appeal should be dismissed; and is hereby dismissed.  The judgment of the Court below is affirmed by me. The conviction and sentence of the Appellant by the Court below to a prison term of seven 7 years is affirmed by me.  The bail granted to the Appellant after conviction is hereby revoked. The Appellant shall be taken back to the prison Correctional Centre to complete the prison term imposed on him by the Court below.   CHIDI NWAOMA UWA, J.C.A.:  I read before now a draft copy of the judgment delivered by my learned brother JAMES SHEHU ABIRIYI, JCA. I agree with my learned brother’s reasoning and conclusion arrived at in dismissing the appeal. I also dismiss it. I abide by the order revoking the bail granted to the Appellant after his conviction and also order that the Appellant be taken back to the correctional centre to complete the prison term imposed on him by the trial Court.   ABDULLAHI MAHMUD BAYERO, J.C.A.:  I agree.-end! " ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The Appellant was tried, convicted and sentenced to a prison term of seven (7) years for the offence of rape contrary to Section 283 of the Penal Code. He was alleged to have raped the PW3 who was on an errand for her mother along with PW1. The Appellant came on a motorcycle, picked the PW3, held her with one hand and drove away with her. He drove around with her despite her cries. At one point, he stopped and somebody came with a machete and asked why she was crying. The Appellant told the person to forget about her. Then the Appellant took her behind a filling station, pushed her to the ground and had an illicit sexual intercourse with the PW3. The Appellant then put her back on the motorcycle, brought her to a roundabout and when he saw her mother (PW2) and some other people, he pushed her off, threw Four Hundred Naira (N400) on her and rode off. PW3’s mother and those with her lifted the PW3 from the ground and took her to the police station where she gave her statement. When arrested, Appellant first made a statement denying the intercourse but admitting driving her around at her request. Thereafter, he made another statement denying the making of the first statement.-" ;

The return of the Plaintiff’s plants, equipment, materials and tools as set out in paragraph 24b herein in good condition or their value in the sum of N23,613,030.00 or as may be assessed. 6. The sum of N12,551,577.00 damages for loss of use of the plants, equipments, materials and tools for the period 1986 to 1991.  Issues were duly joined and the case went to trial. At the close of evidence, counsel addressed the Court and in a well-considered judgment delivered on the 301098, the learned trial Judge found the Plaintiff’s case as proved and granted all the reliefs sought. The Appellant who was the 2nd Defendant in the trial Court, was dissatisfied with the decision of the trial Court and therefore filed this appeal.  The Original Notice of Appeal at pages 565 - 566 of the record of appeal was dated and filed on the 301098. Same was amended by leave of this Court granted on the 14112016. This appeal was therefore heard on the Amended Notice of Appeal filed on the 031116 but Deemed filed on the 14112016. The Appellant therefore complied with the Rules of this Court by filing an Appellant’s Brief of Arguments which was amended by leave of this Court. The extant Appellant’s Brief is therefore, the Amended Appellant’s Brief of Arguments which was filed on the 18112016. Therein, four issues were distilled for determination as follows: 1. Whether the learned trial Judge was right when he held that the Respondent’s action was not statute barred? 2. Whether the learned trial Judge was right when he held that Exhibit “1” before the Court is a proper notice to commencement of action which also binds the Appellant? 3. Whether having regard to the totality of the evidence on record, the learned trial Judge was right when he held that there was a contract between the Appellant and the Respondent? 4. Whether the Respondent established its case before the Honourable Court below, to be entitled to judgment.  The Respondents did not file any Respondent’s Brief of Arguments. Consequently, on the Motion of the Appellant filed on the 02317 and granted on the 71118, this Court set down the appeal for hearing on the Appellant’s Brief of Arguments alone, the Respondents having failed to filed their Brief of Arguments. On the 27012020, when this appeal was heard, learned counsel for the Appellant adopted the Appellant’s Brief of Arguments and urged us to allow the appeal.  Now, before I proceed if there is need to do so, I would like to point out that, I have carefully perused the Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim both filed on the 25391, it would be seen that same were issued out and signed in the name of Bandele A. Aiku & Co.; a Law Firm. Similarly, the Writ of Summons filed on the 22102008 and Statement of Claim also filed on the 22102008 were signed in the name of Bandele A. Aiku & Co; the same Law Firm. The Further Amended Statement of Claim upon which the suit was heard and determined, and filed on the 28296 was also issued and signed in the name of Bandele Aiku & Co.  The law is now settled that any originating process, and indeed any other Court process purported to be signed by a Legal Practitioner, must be signed by a Legal Practitioner known to the Nigerian Law. Such a person must be a human being who has been called to bar to practice as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. The name of such a person must therefore be on the register or roll of Legal Practitioners kept in the Supreme Court Registry, Consequently, any originating process or other Court process signed in the name of a Law Firm will be incompetent and a nullity. Accordingly any proceeding conducted and judgment given pursuant to such null process, will be set aside on appeal. See Zartech Limited v. Olaogun Enterprises Limited 2016 LPELR - 41927CA; GTB v. Innoson Nigeria Ltd 2017 LPELR - 42368 SC; Chief Sule Adetona & Ors v. Abudu Obaoku & Ors 2016 LPELR - 41931 CA; Okafor v. Nweke 2007 10 NWLR pt.1043 521; F.B.N. Plc v. Maiwada 2013 5 NWLR pt.1348 444; Alhaji Tajudeen Babatunde Hamzat & Anor v. Alhaji Saliu Ireyemi Sanni & Ors2015 LPELR - 24302 SC and Amidu Ishola & Ors v. Ibadan North-East Local Gov’t & Anor 2013 LPELR - 20477 CA. Thus in Okarika & Ors v. Samuel & Anor 2013 7 NWLR pt.1352 19, my Lord, I.T. Muhammad, J.S.C. as he then was observed as follows: “Initiating a process in a Court of first instance or an Appeal which lies to an Appeal Court has to be sponsored by a person, natural or artificial. In case the Appeal proceeds from a natural person, it has to be filed and prosecuted by that natural person who has the capacity to see, hear, talk, feel or perceive or, where circumstances demand, by his counsel who has the same qualitiescapacity. Where the process or Appeal proceeds from an artificial person such as a corporation or a law firm, that corporation or law firm has to be represented by a natural person such as Director, Manager, Company Secretary natural Person etc who should have pursued the matter on its behalf or by mandating a legal practitioners who should pursue the matterappeal to its logical conclusion. This is because, the corporation, law firm or company lacks these human qualities which will qualify it to pursue the matterappeal to its logical conclusion. That is why it is improper where a law firm is consulted by an individual for legal services to indicate on the initiating processes that such a process is signed by the law firm. The law firm is incapable of signing the process.”  It is settled therefore that, such a Court process signed in the name of a Law Firm is incurably defective and cannot be cured by an amendment, it being a nullity. The issue is one of substantive law, and not a matter of mere procedure. Accordingly, any originating process filed in breach of a statutory provision, such as Sections 21 and 24 of the Legal Practitioners’ Act, is null and void and cannot be relied upon in any judicial proceeding. See Rev. Dr. A. B. Ayanlowo v. Sagamu Local Government & Anor 2016 LPELR - 41936 CA; Akinsanya & Ors v. Shoneye 2016 LPELR - 41939 CA; Ajayi v. Oguntowo & Anor 2017 LPELR - 42387 CA and SLB Consortium Ltd v. NNPC 2011 9 NWLR pt.1252 317. Thus inProfessor A. B. Fafunwa v. Bellview Travels Ltd 2013 LPELR - 20800 CA; this Court per Augie, J.C.A. as he then was held that: “The situation is not any different from that in Okafor v. Nweke 2007 10 NWLR pt.1043 521, where the Supreme Court hammered the nail down hard with its decision that a law firm cannot legally sign andor file any process in the Courts; and that any such process signed by a law firm is “incompetent in law”, which means that the process is not only defective but also incurably bad, and in a case like this one, robs the Court of the jurisdiction to entertain the suit.”  It therefore follows that the Writ of Summons and Statements of Claim in this case, which were signed in the name of Bandele A. Aiku & Co., are null and void, and the Trial Court was therefore deprived of the jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter. Those originating processes have been declared to be a nullity, the entire proceedings conducted thereon and the judgments are also null and void. They are accordingly set aside for being a nullity.  Consequently, the entire proceedings of the trial Court and the judgment of the Oyo State High Court delivered on the 30th day of October, 1998 in Suit No: HOG1191 based on those null processes are hereby set aside.   NONYEREM OKORONKWO, J.C.A.:  The Writ of Summons and the Statement of Claim by which proceedings were begun in this case leading to this appeal were signed by Bandete A. Aiku & Co. a Law Firm.  The Law has become now hackneyed that an Originating Process has to be signed by the Suitor or by the Legal Practitioner representing the Suitor under the various rules of Court. The Legal Practitioners Act 1975 has defined who a legal practitioner is which excludes a Law Firm.  A Law firm cannot purport to initial or sign a process such as the Writ of Summons by which this action is commence, such practice has variously been held to result in a nullity. This one is also a nullity and nothing can stand on it.  I therefore agree with the lead judgment of my Lord Haruna Simon Tsammani, J.C.A. that the nullity has vitiated the entire proceedings which are set aside.   FOLASADE AYODEJI OJO, J.C.A.:  I have had the privilege to read in draft, the lead judgment of my learned brother, Haruna Simon Tsammani, J.C.A.  It is not in dispute that the originating processes, that is, the Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim with which the action was commenced before the lower Court was not signed by a legal practitioner enrolled in the Supreme Court of Nigeria. This constitutes a brazen breach of Sections 21 and 24 of the Legal Practitioners Act. The law is trite that where there is fundamental failure to comply with the requirement of a statute the resultant effect is not a mere irregularity, but a nullity. See Nigercare Development Co. Ltd vs. Adamawa State Water Board & Ors 2008 9 NWLR Pt. 1093 498; Eimskip Ltd vs. Exquisite Industries Nig Ltd 2003 4 NWLR Pt. 809 88. The said originating processes are thus null and void. See also the cases Okafor v Nweke 2007 10 NWLR Pt. 1043 521; Oketade vs. Adewunmi2010 8 NWLR Pt. 119563; SLB Consortium Ltd vs. NNPC 2011 9 NWLR Pt. 1252 317; Okwuosa vs. Gomwalk & Ors 2017 9 NWLR Pt. 1570 259; Alikor vs. Ogwo 2019 15 NWLR Pt. 1695 331; Ministry of Works and Transport, Adamawa State vs. Yakubu 2013 6 NWLR Pt. 1351 481 on the effect of signing Court processes in the name of a law firm. In Braithwaite vs. Skye Bank Plc 2013 5 NWLR Pt 1346 1, the Supreme Court, per Muhammad, J.S.C. held that: In my considered opinion, the words employed in drafting Sections 2 1 of the Legal Practitioner’s Act, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria and Section 24 of the Legal Practitioner's Act, Law of the Federation of Nigeria are simple and straight forward. The literal construction of the law is that Legal Practitioners who are animate personalities should sign Court processes and not a firm of legal practitioners which is inanimate and cannot be found in the roll of this Court.  Further addressing the collateral issue similarly raised in the case at hand as it was earlier raised in Okafor vs. Nweke before then, His Lordship Fabiyi, J.S.C. proceeded at page 21 of the judgment thus: “The decision in Okafor vs. Nweke was based on a substantive law - an Act of the National Assembly i.e. the Legal Practitioners Act. It is not based on Rules of Court.\" I am in complete agreement with my learned brother that a Court process signed in the name of a law firm is incurably defective and cannot be relied upon in any judicial proceeding. Failure to commence a suit with a valid Writ andor Statement of Claim goes to the root of the action. See Madukolu vs. Nkemdilim; 1962 2 SCNLR 341;Hamzat & Anor. v Sanni & Ors2015 5 NWLR Pt. 1453 486; Kida vs. Ogunmola 2006 13 NWLR Pt. 997.  In the circumstance and for the fuller reasons contained in the lead Judgment, I also set aside the proceedings conducted before the lower Court as well as the Judgment premised thereon.-end!

    lexlegal:hasJudgement " PAUL ADAMU GALUMJE, J.S.C. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  The respondent herein, as plaintiff at the High Court of Lagos State claimed at paragraph 23 of its statement of claim filed on the 31st March 2014, the following reliefs:- 1. The sum of N95,399,765.28 and the sum of $875,949.22 being the unpaid balance of money for the supply of scaffolding materials and services to the defendant for the Chevron EGP-3B project, offshore Warri Delta State. 2. The sum of N43,522,300.00 being the total cost of the unrecovered scaffolding materials and equipment in possession of the defendant at Chevron EGP-3G project, offshore Warri Delta State which have been rendered unfit and unusable due to salty water and high humidity at the project site. 3. An order for the release of 2 offshore materials baskets belonging to the claimant still in NIWA yard warehouse of the defendant in Warri.  The appellant herein filed a statement of defence on the 3rd of October, 2014. The respondent filed a reply on the 29th December, 2014.  Issues having been joined, the case was set down for hearing before Oke Lawal, J. on the 7th July, 2014. The appellant was not in Court and was not represented by a counsel. Hearing notice was ordered to be served on the appellant and the matter was further adjourned to the 15th September, 2014 at the request of its counsel who informed the Court that a move was being initiated for the matter to be settled out of Court. The Court did not sit on the 15th September, 2014 and the matter was adjourned to 13th October, 2014. On the said 13th October, 2014 Mr. Stephen Efediogor, learned counsel for the appellant applied for and was granted an adjournment in order to regularize the appellants processes. On 20th November, 2014 when the case came up, learned counsel for the appellant instead of regularizing their processes, moved a motion urging the Court to strike out the writ and the statement of claim for being irregular. The motion was heard and dismissed and the appellant was ordered to regularize its processes. The matter was then adjourned to 18th December, 2014 for mention and to hear the appellants motion seeking to regularize its processes. On the 18th December 2014, appellant moved its motion for extension of time to file its statement of defence, and same was granted and the case was adjourned to 19th and 26th January, 2015 for hearing. On 11th February 2015, Okey Wali learned counsel for the plaintiff, now respondent informed the Court about a possibility for settlement out of Court. The case was then adjourned to 25th March, 2015 for report of settlement. On the 6th of May 2015, the Court was informed of the parties' failure to settle.  It was at this stage that parties were directed to file forms 17 and 18 which deal with issues for determination and answers and the matter was adjourned to 17th June, 2015 as agreed by counsel for respective parties. The respondent filed forms 17 and 18 and the appellant also did the same, after having informed the Court that it had paid N20,000.00 to the respondent. On the 24th November, 2015 the appellants counsel drew the attention of the Court to a motion he filed on the 17th June, 2015 in which he sought for an order of dismissal of the suit on the ground that same had been abandoned by the respondent.  The trial Court took the application and dismissed it and the matter was adjourned to 15th of December, 2015 for case management conference.  Learned counsel for the appellant filed a notice of appeal on the 2nd December, 2015 against the ruling of 24th November,2015. After filing the appeal, the appellant failed to compile record. On the 15th December, 2015 when the case management conference was to commence, the appellant's counsel applied for adjournment, and the matter was adjourned to 26th January, 2016. On that day the case management conference went on and was later adjourned to 16th February, 2016. On that day the Court did not sit and the registrar of the Court sent fresh hearing notice to the parties, informing them that the matter had been adjourned to the 15th March, 2016 for continuation of the case management conference. On the appointed day when the matter came up for continuation of the case management conference, the appellant and his counsel were absent. The respondent applied for judgment under Order 25 Rule 6 2b of the High Court Civil Procedure Rules, 2012. The Court granted the application and went on to enter judgment for the respondent herein. By a motion on notice filed on the 18th March 2016, the appellant prayed the Court to set aside the judgment delivered on the 15th March, 2016. The application was refused. Appellant's appeal against the judgment of the Lagos State High Court was on the 10th March, 2017 dismissed by the Court of Appeal, hence this appeal. The appellant's notice of appeal, at pages 810- 816, filed on the 13th March, 2017 contains eight grounds of appeal.  Parties filed and exchanged briefs of argument. The appellant's brief of argument, settled by Mr. L.I.T. Erhabor was filed on the 17th July, 2017.  Three issues were formulated for determination of this appeal in the following order:- 1. Whether the lower Court was right to hold that the appellant was aware of the date the default judgment was entered when no hearing notice was served on the appellant. 2. Whether the lower Court was right to have upheld the default judgment entered against the appellant, when there was no proof of service of any hearing notice on the appellant before the trial Court, as at the time the default judgment was entered. 3. Whether from the material fact available in the record, the lower Court came to a right decision when it held at page 804 of the record that the default judgment was entered within the three months period of the commencement of case management conference CMC in accordance with the provisions of High Court of Lagos State Civil Procedure Rules 2012.  Mr. Okey Wali, learned senior counsel for the respondent issued a preliminary objection to the competence of this appeal which he filed on the 26th February, 2018. The grounds upon which the preliminary objection is based are:- i The grounds of appeal relied upon by the appellant in Notice of appeal is a combination of both law and facts. ii By the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the appellant cannot appeal as of right where the grounds of appeals contain both facts and law, but must first seek the leave of Court to so do. iii The Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. iv The appellant's notice of appeal filed on 13th day of March, 2017, is incompetent, for failure to obtain the said leave of Court to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal as required by the express provision of Section 2331 2 3 of the 1999 Constitution. v Ground 2 of the notice of appeal and the particulars thereof, specifically paragraphs ii and iii are pure analysis of the exercise of discretion of the lower Court, thus leave is required to appeal same. vi Grounds 6 and 7 of the notice of appeal and the particulars thereof are mixture of both facts and law; hence leave of Court to appeal must be first sought and granted.  The preliminary objection is argued in the respondents brief of argument. In case the preliminary objection is overruled. Learned senior counsel equally formulated three issues for determination of this appeal in the following terms:- a Whether the lower Court was right when it held that the appellant was notified of the date the default judgment was entered. b Whether the lower Court was right to have upheld the default judgment entered against the appellant, having found that the appellant was sufficiently notified of the date the default judgment was entered. c Whether the lower Court came to a right decision when from the material facts available in the record it found that the default judgment was within the three months period from the date of commencement of case management conference CMC in accordance with the provisions of the High Court of Lagos State Civil Procedure Rules 2012.  Learned counsel for the appellant filed a reply brief on the 6th of December, 2017.  A preliminary objection to the competence of an appeal, is an objection, if upheld, renders further proceedings before the Court or tribunal unnecessary. Therefore, when it is raised, it must be resolved before venturing into the appeal.  The respondents notice of preliminary objection reads as follows:- TAKE NOTICE that the respondent herein shall, at or before the hearing of this appeal, raise and rely upon the following preliminary objection against the appellants appeal and pray the Honourable Court for:- AN ORDER striking out or dismissing the appellants appeal.  I have reproduced the grounds of objection elsewhere in this judgment. From the contents of the notice, it will appear that the objection is directed at the hearing of the appeal. However, learned senior counsel for the respondentobjector in his argument in support of the preliminary objection at pages 2-7 of the respondents brief of argument, attacked only the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th and 7th grounds of appeal. The appellants notice of appeal filed on 13th March, 2017 contains eight grounds of appeal. Since no argument was preferred in respect of the 1st, 5th and 8th grounds of appeal by the learned senior counsel for the respondentobjector, it means those grounds are competent, as such they can sustain the appeal. Order 2 Rule 91 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2014 as amended provides as follows:- “A respondent intending to rely upon a preliminary objection to the hearing of the appeal, shall give the appellant three clear days notice thereof before the hearing, setting out the grounds of objection, and shall file such notice together with ten copies thereof with the registrar within the same time.\" Italics is mine for Emphasis.  The emphasis is that a preliminary objection can only be issued against the hearing of the appeal, and not against a selection of grounds of appeal, which even if it is upheld cannot terminate the appeal in limine. In KLM Royal Dutch Airlines v. Aloma 2017 LPELR- 42588 SC, this Court, per Kudirat Motonmori Olatokunbo Kekere-Ekun, JSC at pages 6-7, paras D-B, held:-  The purpose of a preliminary objection is to truncate the hearing of an appeal in limine. It is raised where the respondent is satisfied that there is a fundamental defect in the appeal that would affect the Courts jurisdiction to entertain it. Where there are other grounds that could sustain the appeal, a preliminary objection should not be filed. Where the purpose of the objection is merely to challenge the competence of some grounds of appeal, the best procedure is by way of motion on notice. The reason is that the success of the objection would not terminate the hearing of the appeal. See Odunukwe v. Ofomata 2010 18 NWLR Pt.1225 404 at 423 C-F, Ndigwe v. Nwude 1999 11 NWLR Pt.626 314; N.E.P.A. v. Ango 2001 15 NWLR Pt. 734 627; Muhammed v. Military Administrator Plateau State 2001 18 NWLR Pt.744 183.  See also the case of Adejumo v. Olawaiye 2014 12 NWLRPt.1421 252 at 279 where this Court, per Rhodes-Vivour said:- A preliminary objection should only be filed against the hearing of an appeal and not against one or more grounds of appeal which are not capable of disturbing the hearing of the appeal... Where a preliminary objection would not be the appropriate process to object or show to the Court defects in processes before it, a motion on notice filed complaining of a few grounds or defects would suffice.  From the authorities I have highlighted above, it is clear that the preliminary objection in the instant case is inappropriate and same is liable to be struck out. Accordingly, same is hereby struck out.  For the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant formulated three issues for appropriate determination of this appeal, and they are reproduced hereunder as follows:- 1.Whether the lower Court was right to hold that the appellant was aware of the date the default judgment was entered when no hearing notice was served on the appellant. 2. Whether the lower Court was right to have upheld the default judgment entered against the appellant, when there was no proof of service of any hearing notice on the appellant before the trial Court as at the time the default judgment was entered. 3. Whether from the material facts available in the record the lower Court came to a right decision when it held at page 804 of the record that the default judgment was entered within the three months' period of the commencement of case management conference CMC in accordance with the provision of High Court of Lagos State Civil Procedure Rules, 2012.  For the respondent, three issues were formulated as follows:- a Whether the lower Court was right when it held that the appellant was notified of the date the default judgment was entered. b Whether the lower Court was right to have upheld the default judgment entered against the appellant, having found that the appellant was sufficiently notified of the date the default judgment was entered. c Whether the lower Court came to a right decision when from the material facts available in the record it found that the default judgment was within the three months period from the date of commencement of case management conference CMC in accordance with the provisions of the High Court of Lagos State Civil Procedure Rules.  The issues formulated for determination of this appeal by the parties are similar. However, it is the appellant that is aggrieved by the decision of the lower Court.  It is his grievances that are being addressed in this appeal. The respondents duty is to reply to those grievances. This being so, I will adopt the issues formulated by the appellant in the determination of this appeal. Issues one and two are complaints against service of Court process on the appellant. They will therefore be considered together, while the 3rd issue will be treated separately.  Learned counsel for the appellant, in his argument, submitted that the appellant was not served with hearing notice against the 15th of March 2016, the day the default judgment, subject matter of this appeal, was entered against him. Learned counsel submitted that although electronic service is permitted by the rules of the trial Court, none was effected on the appellant, and there was no affidavit of service to that effect. According to the learned counsel, there was no evidence before the trial Court upon which the lower Court could come to the conclusion or assumed that the text message which the Court room registrar of the trial Court allegedly sent to the appellants learned counsels phone was received. In a further argument, learned counsel submitted that since the trial Court did not sit at the last adjourned date, it was absolutely necessary to verify whether the appellant who was absent at the previous session was properly served. Failure of the trial Court to verify whether the appellant was served was fatal to the Courts proceedings, and the lower Court was wrong in upholding the decision of the trial Court. In aid, Learned counsel cited Arabella v. NAIC 2008 FWLR Pt.44 1208 at 176 paras. E - G; Ahmed v. Ahmed 2013 15 NWLR Pt.1377 274 at 349, paras E-G.  Finally, learned counsel urged this Court to hold that the appellant was denied the right of fair hearing when it entered judgment without confirming that the appellant was served with hearing notice that the matter was fixed for 15th March, 2016 for continuation of the Case Management Conference.  Mr. Okey Wali, learned senior counsel for respondent submitted that the lower Court was right when it upheld the default judgment entered against the appellant on the 15th March, 2016 for default of appearance. Learned senior counsel argued forcefully, as a preliminary point that the issue of whether the appellant was aware of the date the default judgment was entered, was never in contention at the lower Court. According to the learned senior counsel, the appellants contention at the lower Court was basically the mode of service of the hearing notice which was effected by the use of short message service SMS to the phone numbers of the counsel in this matter intimating them of the next date of adjournment.  In the appellants reply brief, the only new issue worthy of a reply was the appearance in Court of the learned counsel for the appellant on the 16th March, 2016. Learned counsel considered that issue that was raised by learned counsel for respondents preposterous, unimaginable and unthinkable that he appeared as a result of the SMS allegedly sent to his phone. Apart from this, learned counsel only reargued the 1st and 2nd issue for determination of this appeal that have to do with service of hearing notice. The essence of a reply brief is not to reopen argument already canvassed. It is to reply to new issues that have arisen in the respondents brief of argument.  In resolving the issue of service, the lower Court per Nimpar, JCA said:- I am of the view that the Court below was in order by directing that the appellant should be informed by text. The Court has a discretion to direct the notification in a particular way. Issuance of a hard copy hearing notice is not a requirement of law and failure to issue and serve same cannot offend the rule of fair hearing.  Order 7 Rule 13 of the Lagos State High Court Civil Procedure Rules 2012 provides as follows:- After serving any process, the process server shall promptly depose to and file an affidavit setting out the fact, date, time, place and mode of service describing the process served and shall exhibit the acknowledgement of service, such affidavit shall be prima facie proof of service.  The appellants amended brief of argument at the lower Court is at pages 699-725 of the record of this appeal. At page 702 of the record, learned counsel for the appellant submitted three issues for determination of the appeal. The specific issue that concerned the question of service is the 2nd issue for determination of the appellants appeal and I reproduce same hereunder as follows:- Whether the lower Court was right when it entered default judgment against the defendant for failure of appearance when no hearing notice was served on the defendant as required by law.   Throughout the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant at the lower Court, learned counsel did not deny knowledge of the fact that this matter was fixed for Case Management Conference on the 15th of March, 2016. Learned counsels argument concentrated on the fact that the service of process was not in conformity with Order 7 Rule 13 of the Lagos High Court Civil Procedure Rules. In that regard, learned counsel cited Okoye v. C.P.M.B. Ltd 2008 11 M.J.S.C. 76 at 88, paras C-D, Arabella v. NAIC supra, Ahmed v. Ahmed Supra.  In this Court, learned counsel for the appellant has argued forcefully that no hearing notice was served on the appellant informing it or its counsel that the case was adjourned to 15th March 2016, the date the default judgment was entered. Learned counsels argument in this Court has clearly set out a scenario different from the appellants argument at the lower Court. Learned counsel for the appellant said the service was not in accordance with the law as such even if he knew the date the case was adjourned to, his failure to appear would have not been the reason for entering judgment in default of appearance.  Before this Court, the story is that the date to which the case was adjourned was not communicated to him. Although the receiving of hearing notice is a new issue in this Court, it can be raised without leave of the Court, since it has bearing on the jurisdiction of the trial Court, the Court of Appeal and this Court.  What then is the essence of hearing notice? The issue of service of hearing notice on a party notifying him of the hearing date of matters is very fundamental to the administration of justice. It is the service of hearing notice that confers on the Court the jurisdictional competence to entertain the matter before it. Thus where a matter is adjourned to a date other than the date the parties had previous notice of hearing, the Court has a duty to notify them of the subsequent adjournment. The Court should not predicate its decision on mere assumption that a party must have been served with Court process at one stage and that he should be aware of the subsequent hearing dates. See Obimonure v. Erinosho 1966 1 ANLR 250, Skenconsult Nig. Ltd v. Ukey 1981 1 SC.6; Wema Bank Nig. Ltd v. Odulaja 2000 FWLR Pt.17 138 142-143.  In the instant case, there is evidence that parties left their phone numbers with the registry of the Court. The phone numbers were supplied for the purpose of communication between the parties in this matter and the registry. There is evidence that a text message containing 15th March, 2016 as the hearing date of this matter was sent to learned counsel for respective parties through their phone numbers. Clearly, parties were properly served with hearing notice. I agree with the lower Court that at this age of information technology super highway, it will be foolhardy for any litigant to insist on being served with hard copy hearing notice. Once a notice is sent to the GSM numbers supplied by the litigants, that is sufficient. Learned senior counsel for the respondent was served the same way appellants counsel was served. At the lower Court, learned counsel for the appellant did not deny at the earliest opportunity that he did not receive any hearing notice. He only argued that the hearing notice was not served in accordance with the rules of Lagos State High Court. His sudden somersault before this Court is an attempt to frustrate the speedy disposal of this case. From the history of this case, learned counsel for the appellant has not been forthright in pursuit of this case. Having therefore been properly served with hearing notice, the appellants right of fair hearing has not been breached at all. The 1st and 2nd issues are resolved against the appellant.  The third and last issue is whether the default judgment was entered against the appellant within the three months period of case Management Conference in accordance with the provisions of High Court of Lagos State Civil Procedure Rules 2012. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the default judgment was delivered after the expiration of three months, contrary to the provision of Order 25 Rules 1 and 2g of the High Court of Lagos State Civil Procedure Rules. It is learned counsel contention that, any proceedings or judgment after the expiration of the period for case management conference is null and void if none of the parties applies for and is granted extension of time. In a further argument, learned counsel submitted that in the instant case, there was no extension of time, as such the default judgment, subject matter of this appeal is null and void. Learned counsel therefore urged this Court to either allow the appeal and dismiss the suit or set aside the judgment of the lower Court delivered on the 10th March, 2017 and remit the case for trial on merit before another Judge.  Learned senior counsel for the respondent submitted in reply that the case management conference commenced on the 26th of January, 2016 and was due to lapse on the 25th April, 2016. Learned senior counsel submitted that the case management conference started late due to numerous applications by the learned counsel for the appellant.  The lower Court in its judgment at page 804 said:- To resolve the question of whether 3 months had expired, the starting date must be identified and three months therefrom can be easily discerned. When did the process commence? The record of proceedings Sicpage 557 shows that the Court below dismissed an application to dismiss the appeal on the 24th November, 2015 for failure to apply for case management conference as required by Order 25 Rule 1 1 and 3 of the Lagos State High Court, Rules. The case was adjourned to 15th December, 2015 for the case management conference to start, but was aborted by the appellant who informed the Court they were desirous of settlement of the pre-trial conference. On the next date being the 26th January, 2016, the conference started. So the started Sic, Starting date is 26th January, 2016 and three months would ordinarily take us to 25th March, 2016. The judgment was entered on the 15th of March, 2016 within the period of pre-trial conference.  I totally agree with the lower Court. Order 25 Rules 1 and 2 a of the Lagos State High Court Civil Procedure Rules provides as follows:- 1. Within fourteen 14 days after close of pleadings, the claimant shall apply for the issuance of a Case Management Conference Notice as in form 17. 2. Upon application by a claimant under Sub-rule 1 above, the Judge shall cause to be issued to the parties and their legal practitioners if any a case management conference notice as in form 17 accompanied management information sheet as in form 18 for the purposes set out hereunder: - a disposal of matters which must or can be dealt with on interlocutory application; b giving such direction as to the future course of the action as appears best adopted to secure its just, expeditious and economical disposal; c promoting amicable settlement of the case or adoption of ADR. 2. At the Case Management Conference, the Judge shall consider and take appropriate action with respect to such of following or aspects of them as may be necessary or desirable. g Hearing and determination of applications and objections on points of Law.  Learned counsel for the appellant has argued that what kick-started the case management conference in this case on appeal was not the orderdirective of Court, but the filing and service of form 18, signed by the Registrar of the trial Court on the 7th of May, 2015 after pleadings were closed. Order 25 Rules 1 and 2 clearly provides 14 days within which a claimant shall apply for issuance of a case management conference notice as in form 17, after close of pleadings. From the history of this case where the appellants herein erected road blocks to expeditious hearing and determination of this case, the normal schedules for applying for case management conference and disposal of the case within the prescribed period was clearly put asunder. This is the reason why the lower Court did not hide its displeasure with the conduct of the learned counsel for the appellant when it said:- It may be safely concluded that the appellant was technically planning to scuttle the proceedings so that the pre-trial conference will expire and that explains its application to go settle and refusal to come to Court even when notified by the registrar of the Court below. For all I have said, I entirely agree with the learned senior counsel that the default judgment was not entered outside the three months prescribed by the Lagos State High Court Civil Procedure Rules 2012. This issue is resolved against the appellant.  Having resolved the three issues submitted for determination against the appellant, this appeal shall be and it is hereby dismissed.  The cost of prosecuting this appeal is assessed at N500,000.00 in favour of the respondent and against the appellant.   IBRAHIM TANKO MUHAMMAD, C.J.N.:  I have had the privilege of reading in advance the judgment of my learned brother, Galumje, JSC. I agree with his Lordships reasoning and conclusion that the appeal ought to be dismissed. I too hereby, dismiss the appeal. I abide by all orders made in the lead judgment.   OLUKAYODE ARIWOOLA, J.S.C.:  I had the privilege of reading in draft the lead judgment of my learned brother, Galumje, JSC just delivered. I agree entirely with the reasoning and conclusion that the appeal lacks merit and should be dismissed. I too will dismiss the appeal.  I abide by the consequential order in the leading judgment including the order on costs. Appeal dismissed.   JOHN INYANG OKORO, J.S.C.:  I am in agreement with the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Paul Adamu Galumje, JSC. For emphasis on the reasons adumbrated therein, I shall proffer a few comments of my own.  I hold the view that issues 1 and 2 formulated by both parties, which are similar, are central and sufficient to the determination of this appeal. The fulcrum of the appellants grievance is on non-service of hearing notice, hence denial of fair hearing.  Service of hearing notice before hearing any matter in Court is fundamental to the exercise of Courts jurisdiction over the matter before it. Hearing notice is the only legal means of informing a party who was absent from Court of the return date. Where the Court is satisfied that hearing notice had not been served on a party, it would not proceed with the business of the day. See Alhaji Auwalu Darma v. Ecobank Nig. Ltd 2017 9 NWLR Pt. 1571 480 at 511; Nigerian Agricultural & Co-operative Bank Ltd v. Mr. Lewechi Ozoemelam 2016 9 NWLR Pt. 1517 376.  In the instant appeal, there is evidence that a text message was sent by the registry of the Court to the G.S.M. numbers provided by counsel to both parties informing them that the matter had been adjourned to 15th March, 2016 for continuation of the case management conference. The respondent as plaintiff attended Court on the said 15th March, 2016 but the appellant stayed away. I hold the view that at this age of prevalence of information technology, the service of hearing notice through text message by the registrar of Court is good and sufficient notice.  Now, the question begging for answer is whether the appellant was denied fair hearing by the trial Court. My answer to the above question is in the negative. The appellant cannot complain of denial of fair hearing when it had ample opportunity to defend itself but failed to avail itself of that opportunity. The settled position of the law is that once a trial Court has given a party ample opportunity to defend himself and the party does not avail himself of that opportunity, then the party cannot complain that he was denied fair hearing. See Ogunsanya v. State 2011 12 NWLR Pt. 1261 page 40; Ordi Orugbo v. Una 2002 16 NWLR Pt. 792 175.  In the final analysis, I agree entirely with the conclusion of my learned brother in the lead judgment that this appeal has no merit. It is accordingly dismissed by me. I abide by the costs awarded in favour of the respondent and against the appellant.  Appeal dismissed.   UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI, J.S.C.:  I have had a preview of the judgment of my learned brother, P.A. Galumje, JSC just delivered. I agree with the reasoning and conclusion arrived at therein that the appeal is devoid of any merit.  The appellant distilled 3 issues for consideration in this appeal: 1. Whether the lower Court was right to hold that the appellant was aware of the date the default judgment was entered when no hearing notice was served on the appellant. 2. Whether the lower Court was right to have upheld the default judgment entered against the appellant, when there was no proof of service of any hearing notice on the appellant before the trial Court, as at the time the default judgment was entered. 3. Whether from the material fact available in the record, the lower Court came to a right decision when it held at page 804 of the record that the default judgment was entered within the three months' period of the commencement of case management conference CMC in accordance with the provisions of High Court of Lagos State Civil Procedure Rules, 2012.  The fuller facts are contained in the lead judgment of my learned brother. Nevertheless, the default judgment entered against the appellant was as a result of lack of appearances by the learned counsel to the appellant and the chequered and protracted history in the proceedings of the trial Court that necessitated the respondents learned senior counsel to apply for default judgment under Order 25 Rule 62b of the High Court Civil Procedure Rules, 2012. On appeal to the lower Court to set the default judgment aside, the appellant lost and here in the apex Court, my learned brother has dismissed same.  May I dwell on the issue of hearing notice that was allegedly not served on the appellant as amounting to denial of fair hearing. It is however the mode of service that is being challenged by the appellants learned counsel in this appeal to have denied him fair hearing. Failure to give notice of proceedings to the opposing party in a case where service of process is required is a fundamental omission which renders such proceedings void. This is so because the Court would have no jurisdiction to entertain it. Hearing notice is a document or information that emanates from the registry of a Court, giving legal notification to parties in a suit the dates on which the suit would be heard. Once a party or his counsel is served hearing notice they are both deemed to have actual knowledge of the date the suit would be heard, and if such a party decides to stay away from Court he does so at his own peril. See Per RHODES-VIVOUR, JSC in DARMA v. ECOBANK 2017 LPELR-41663 SC.  Nevertheless, it is on record that the appellant was served or informed of the hearing date of 1532016 via SMS. The Evidence Act has now taken notice of the technology age we are in that electronic evidence is now admissible. This was ably tackled by my learned brother, per PETER-ODILI, JSC in ENL CONSORTIUM LTD. v. SHAMBILAT SHELTER NIG. LTD. 2018 LPELR- 43902 SC, when he pungently and right held:  The point has to be made that the phone call mode of service would ordinarily be of good service so long as the party is provided the notice at least 48 hours before the scheduled Court date. The regularity of service is no longer jettisoned because it was made electronically as the current rules of Court have ensured. See Order 2 Rule 4c of the Court of Appeal, 2013 rules.  The lower Court in this case reported as COMPACT MANIFOLD & ENERGY SERVICES LTD v. PAZAN SERVICES NIG. LTD. 2017 LPELR-41913 CA, Per NIMPAR, JCA, observed and I adopt and agree with him as a solid legal foundation for electronic service of hearing notice and other legal processes thus: The essence of a hearing notice is to bring to the notice of the party that his matter will come on the date named in the notice of hearing. Can the notice be effected by other means of notification? The answer is in the affirmative. When the rules use the words hearing notice, it did not specify that it must be hardcopy. Was the judge wrong to use the electronic method of informing parties about the date of hearing? I pause here to say this is the 21st century and technology is ruling every aspect of human endeavour and therefore even Courts must be abreast of these technological advancement and be ready to absorb the aspects that will enhance the quality of justice and aid speedy determination of cases. The Courts have also moved on in that regard. Indeed, electronic service has taken root in the Nigerian legal system and it would be strange for anybody to frown at being served electronically. See CONTINENTAL SALES LTD. v. R. SHIPPING INC 2012 LPELR- 7905 CA. I am of the view that the Court below was in order by directing that the appellant should be informed by text. The Court as a discretion to direct the notification in a particular way. Issuance of a hard copy hearing notice is not a requirement of law and failure to issue and serve same cannot offend the rule of fair hearing. See MIRCHANDANI v. PINHEIRO 2001 3 NWLR Pt. 701 552 @ 573. wherein the Court held: It is not in all cases that the absence of it will automatically vitiate trials in the context of Section 36 of the 1999 Constitution. A hearing Notice is not therefore a mandatory judicial process that must be issued and served in all cases. The requirement is a rule of the Court not a statutory requirement. Rules of Court are to aid the Court in adjudication of cases. It is not to arm-twist the Court into becoming a robot.  For the more comprehensive and deeper reasons in the lead judgment of my learned brother, I accordingly dismiss the appeal and I abide by the order as to costs.-end!  " ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The respondent/plaintiff at the High Court of Lagos State claimed for three reliefs including –  1.unpaid balance of money for the supply of scaffolding materials and services to the defendant for the Chevron EGP-3B project, offshore Warri Delta State;  2.cost of the unrecovered scaffolding materials and equipment in possession of the defendant at Chevron EGP-3G project, offshore Warri Delta State which have been rendered unfit and unusable due to salty water and high humidity at the project site; and  3.an order for the release of 2 offshore materials baskets belonging to the claimant still in NIWA yard warehouse of the defendant in Warri. Issues having been joined and the case was set down for hearing, the Defendant orchestrated a series of motions and applications all of which were eventually dismissed by Court as well as applications for a series of adjournments when matter was eventually slated for Case Management Conference.  On a latter date for continuation of the case management conference after an adjournment, the appellant and his counsel were absent. Thereupon, the respondent applied for judgment under Order 25 Rule 6 (2)(b) of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2012 which was granted and judgment entered for the respondent. Appellant's appeal against the judgment of the Lagos State High Court was on the 10th March, 2017 dismissed by the Court of Appeal, hence this appeal. -" ;

I have seen in recent time that parties who have bad cases embrace and make use of the constitutional provisions of fair hearing to bamboozle the adverse party and the Court, with a view to moving the Court away from the live issues in litigation. They make so much weather and sing the familiar song that the constitutional provision is violated or contravened. They do not stop there. They raise the defence in the most inappropriate cases because they have nothing to canvas in favour of their case. The fair hearing provisions in the Constitution is the machinery or locomotive of justice, not a spare part to propel or invigorate the case of the user. It is not a casual principle of law available to a party to be picked up at will in a case and force the Court to apply it to his advantage. On the contrary, it is a formidable and fundamental provision available to a party who is really denied fair hearing because he was not heard or that he was not properly heard in the case. Let the litigants who have nothing useful to advocate in favour of their cases leave the fair hearing constitutional provision alone because it is not available to them just for the asking.”[Adebayo v. A. G., Ogun State (2008) 7 NWLR (Pt. 1085) 201] “Counsel, quite a legion, find the fair hearing principle duly entrenched in the Constitution as a pathway to success whenever they are in trouble on the merit of the case before the Court. Some resort to it as if it is a magic wand to cure all ills of the litigation. A good number of counsel resort to the principle even when it is inapplicable in the case. The Constitutional principle of fair hearing is for both parties in litigation. It is not only for one of the parties. In other words, fair hearing is not a one-way but a two-way traffic in the sense that it must satisfy a double carriage-way, in the context of both the plaintiff and the defendant or both the appellant and the respondent. The Court must not invoke the principle in favour of one of the parties to the disadvantage of the other party undeservedly. The fair hearing principle formerly entrenched in Section 33 of the 1979 Constitution, and now Section 36 of the 1999 Constitution, is not for the weakling, the slumberer, the indolent or the lazy litigant, but it is for the party who is alive and kicking in the judicial process by taking advantage of the principle at the appropriate time. The principle is not available to a party who sets a trap in the litigation process against the Court and accuse the Court of assumed wrong doing even when such so-called wrong doing is, as a matter of fact, propelled or instigated by the party, through his Counsel.” Per NIKI TOBI JC, Newswatch Comm. Ltd. v. Atta (2006) 4 SC (Pt. II) 114, (2006) 12 NWLR (Pt. 993) 144-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  MOHAMMED LAWAL GARBA, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  On the 7th June, 2018, the High Court Lagos State, Ikeja Division Lower Court granted the Respondents motion of 9th November, 2016 for summary judgment against the Appellant, who being dissatisfied therewith, brought this appeal vide the Notice of Appeal dated the same date; i.e. the 7th June, 2018, on three 3 grounds.  In the Appellants brief filed on 30th August, 2018, an issue was formulated from each of the grounds for determination in the appeal as follows: - 1. Whether the refusal of the lower Court to hear and determine the Appellants motion on notice dated the 4th of April, 2017 before giving its judgment is not a denial of the Appellants Fundamental Right to fair hearing guaranteed by Section 36 of the Constitution. Distilled from Ground 3. 2. Having regard to the claim of the Respondent for interest, whether the lower Court was right in granting his motion on notice dated 9th November, 2016 for summary judgment. Distilled from Ground 2 3. Whether the judgment of the lower Court delivered on the 7th day of June, 2018 outside the 90 days limited by Section 2941 of the 1999 Constitution as amended is null and void. Distilled from Ground 31.  Similar issues are also said to arise for decision in the Respondents brief filed on the 5th October, 2018 and since the issues raised by learned counsel for the parties are substantially the same, I would use the formulation by the Appellant in the determination of the appeal.  I intend to deal with issue 3 first, Issue 1 and then Issue 2.  Issue 3: Appellants Submissions: The submissions are that the Respondents motion for summary judgment was heard by the Lower Court on the 22nd February, 2018, and judgment reserved for delivery on the 30th May, 2018, but was eventually delivered on 7th June, 2018, after a period of 103 days from the 22nd February, 2018, in contravention of the provisions of Section 2941 of the 1999 Constitution as amended. The provision of Section 2941 of the Constitution was set out and the case of Ojokolobo v. Alamu 1987 LPELR -2392SC which dealt with the provisions of Section 2581 of the 1979 Constitution said to be im pari materia with the provision of Section 2941 of the 1999 Constitution was cited in support of the argument that non-compliance with the provision renders the judgment null and void.  It is also the argument of Counsel that the Appellant suffered a miscarriage of justice since the Lower Court also failed to hear its pending application to refer the matter for Alternative Dispute Resolution ADR and breached the principles governing summary judgment procedure. NNPC v. Zaria 2014 LPELR-22362CA, College of Education, Ekiadolor v. Obayagbona 2016 LPELR-40154 CA and Akpan v. Union 1999 7 SC Pt. II 13 were referred to for the argument and the Court is prayed to resolve the issue in Appellants favour.  Respondents Submissions: The issue is also Respondents Issue 3 and the arguments on it are to the effect that the facts in the case of Ojokolobo v. Alami supra relied on by the Appellant are different, it is in apposite and does not support the Appellants case. Reference was then made to page 160A of the Record of Appeal whereat the Lower Court responded to the Respondents oral application for re-adoption of final addresses on the basis that delivery of the judgment was outside the ninety 90 days prescribed by the Constitution. It is submitted that the position of the Lower Court was right since no oral evidence was led but only documents were filed in the motion for judgment and that because the Appellants Counsel agreed with the position by the Lower Court expressly, it is now strange for the Appellant to allege miscarriage of justice, without proof thereof as required in the case of Atungwu v. Ochekwu 2013 14 NWLR Pt. 1375 605 @ 624-5. The case of Beks kimse Nigeria Limited v. Africa 2016 1 NWLR Pt. 1494 456 @ 473 was also cited on the requirement of miscarriage of justice occasioned by non-compliance with the provisions of Section 2941 of the Constitution in order for judgment to be declared null and void.  According to Counsel, the Record of Appeal shows that the Lower Court considered and evaluated all the documents filed in the Respondents motion and the Appellant who failed to file any process cannot assume the role of a victim of miscarriage of justice.  Resolution: Pursuant to the provisions of Section 2941 of the 1999 Constitution as amended, all Courts of law in Nigeria; particularly superior Courts of record established directly under the Constitution, have a legal duty and a binding judicial obligation to deliver their judgmentsdecisions in writing not later than ninety 90 days after conclusion of evidence and final addresses in all casesmatters brought before them and furnish all the parties with duly authenticated copies thereof within seven 7 days of the delivery thereof.  The deliberate employment or use of the word shall in the provision takes away and manifestly excludes or removes any discretion, option or choice in compliance by a Court with the mandatory constitutional command that is exhortatory in tenor.  Section 11 of the 1999 Constitution as amended provides that: - This Constitution is supreme and its provisions shall have binding force on all authorities and persons throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria. See also Utih v. Onoyivwe 1991 1 NWLR Pt. 166 166, Achineku v. Ishagba 1988 4 NWLR Pt. 89 411, Maiwada v. FBN, Plc. 1997 4 NWLR Pt. 500 497, Bakoshi v. Chief of Naval Staff 2004 5 NWLR Pt. 896 268, Onochie v. Odogwu 2006 2 SCNJ, 96 @ 114, 2006 6 NWLR Pt. 975 65 @ 89-90, Nwankwo v. YarAdua 2010 12 NWLR Pt. 1209 578 @ 589.  Failure or refusal by a superior Court of record in Nigeria to abide by, comply with or obey the provision in any mattercase would constitute and amount to a contravention and breach of the Constitution by such a Court which renders the failure and refusal unconstitutional. Ordinarily, a breach or non-compliance with or contravention of the Constitution or any of its provisions by a Court of law in the conduct of its judicial proceedings, would render the proceedings and any bye-product or outcome thereof, legally null and void for being unconstitutional. Ifezue v. Mbadugha 1984 1 SCNLR, 427, Knight Frank & Rutley Nigeria Limited v. A.G. Kano State 1998 4 SC, 251, 1998 7 NWLR Pt. 556 Pt. 556 1, Adediran v. Interland Transp. Limited 1999 9 NWLR Pt. 614 155, Adisa v. Oyinwola2000 1 NWLR Pt. 674 116, Attorney General, Abia State v. Attorney General of the Federation 2002 6 NWLR Pt. 673 264. However, in its wisdom, the Constitution in Section 2945, provides that:- 5 The decision of a Court shall not be set aside or treated as a nullity solely on the ground of non-compliance with the provisions of subsection 1 of this section unless the Court exercising jurisdiction by way of appeal or review of that decision is satisfied that the party complaining has suffered a miscarriage of justice by reason thereof.  These provisions simply and expressly say that non-compliance with, contravention or breach of the provision of subsection 1 of the section by a Court of law, shall not alone, be a ground for treating the decision of a Court delivered in the breach or non-compliance as a nullity or be set aside, unless an appellate Court is satisfied that a miscarriage of justice was suffered by reason thereof. In other words, even if a decision of a Court was delivered in breach, contravention of or non-compliance with the provisions of Section 2941 which prescribe and stipulate that the decision shall be delivered within and not later than ninety 90 after the conclusion of evidence and final addresses, such a decision shall remain valid and legally effective, unless the appellate Court reviewing the decision is satisfied that the party complaining of the non-compliance has suffered a miscarriage of justice thereby, when it shall be declared a nullity and set aside on that ground, alone. By these provisions, a decision delivered by a Court of law outside or after the expiration of the period of ninety 90 days prescribed in Subsection 1 of Section 294, is not automatically a nullity or invalidated by the non-compliance alone unless the appellate Court is satisfied that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned and suffered by the party complaining of the non-compliance.  This is the position stated and restated by Supreme Court in the cases of Atungwu v. Ochekwu 2013 14 NWLR Pt. 1375 605, Akoma v. Osenwokwu 2014 11 NWLR Pt. 1419 462, Alimi v. Kosebinu 2016 17 NWLR Pt. 1542 337, among several other cases, as well as by this Court in many cases such as SPDCN v. Commissioner for Land & Housing 2013 11 NWLR Pt. 1310 11 and Total Nigeria Plc v. New Cargo Handling Company Limited 2015 17 NWLR Pt. 1489 558.  In the premises of these authorities, the law is now that an appellant who challenges a decision of a Lower Court on the ground of non-compliance with or breach of the provisions of Section 2941 of the Constitution for being delivered outside or after the expiration of ninety 90 days of the conclusion of evidence and final addresses, has the legal duty and burden not only to prove the non-compliance; which is a matter of fact, but also satisfy the appellate Court that he indeed, suffered a miscarriage of justice in the case by reason of the non-compliance in the delivery of the decision.  In the present appeal, it is not an issue joined by the parties that the summary judgment by the Lower Court was delivered outside and after the expiration of the period of ninety 90 days after the final addresses in respect of the Respondents motion of 9th November, 2016 were adopted on the 22nd February, 2018.  The fact, therefore, that the decisionRuling was not delivered in compliance or in accordance with the prescription of time in the provision of Section 2941 is not in dispute or require proof or further proof by the Appellant. The first condition or limb of the judicial requirement of proof of the non-compliance with the provisions has been satisfied or satisfactorily met by admission or concession of the parties. See: Section 123 of the Evidence Act, 2011, Oguanuhu v. Chiegboka 2013 6 NWLR Pt. 1357 588, Amico Const. Company Limited v. Actec International Limited 2015 17 NWLR Pt. 1487 146, Cole v. Jibunoh 2016 4 NWLR Pt. 1503 499, John Holt, Plc v. Allen 2014 17 NWLR Pt. 1437 443.  The next conjunctive condition in the application of the provision of Section 2941 which is stipulated in subsection 5 is that the Appellant shall satisfy this Court that it suffered a miscarriage of justice by reason that the Lower Courts decisionRuling was delivered in breach of non-compliance with Section 2941, in the peculiar circumstances of the case.  One may then ask the question as to what, generally, is a miscarriage of justice in the judicial proceedings of a Court of law? In the Blacks Law Dictionary, 9th Edition at page 1088, the phrase miscarriage of justice is defined as A grossly unfair outcome in a judicial proceeding, as when a defendant is convicted despite a lack of evidence on an essential element of the crime. Also termed failure of justice.  In the 5th Edition of the Blacks Law Dictionary, cited by Olatawura, JSC in the case of Sanusi v. Ameyogun 1992 1 NWLR Pt. 237 527, the term was defined as: - Decision or outcome of legal proceedings that is prejudicial or inconsistent with substantial right of party.  Then, Tobi, JSC, in his proficiency, defined the concept in the case of Gbadamosi v. Dairo 2007 1-2 SC Pt. II 157, 2007 3 NWLR Pt. 1021 282, as follows: - Miscarriage of justice connotes decision or outcome of legal proceeding that is prejudicial inconsistent with the substantial rights of a party. Miscarriage of justice means a reasonable probability of more favourable outcome of a case for the party alleging it. Miscarriage of justice is unjustice done to the party alleging it.  The Learned Law Lord then said: - The burden of proof is on the party alleging that the justice has been miscarried.  Miscarriage of justice has also been described as simply justice miscarried, failure of justice, failure on the part of the Court to do justice, it is justice misapplied, mis-appreciated, misappropriated, an ill-conduct on the part of the Court which amounts to injustice, such a departure from the rules which permit judicial procedure as to make that which happened not in the proper sense of the word, judicial procedure at all. See: Nnajiofor v. Ukonu 1986 4 NWLR Pt. 36 505, Larmie v. D.P.M.S. Limited 2005 12 SC Pt. 1 93, Akayepe v. Akayepe 2009 11 NWLR Pt. 1152 217, Jinadu v. Esurombi-Aro 2005 14 NWLR Pt. 44 142 @ 184, Onagoruwa v. The State 1993 7 NWLR Pt. 303 49, Okonkwo v. Udoh 1997 9 NWLR Pt. 519 16, Irolo v. Uka 2002 14 NWLR Pt. 786 195, Oguntayo v. Adelaja 2009 15 NWLR Pt. 1153 150 @ 186.  From the definitions of miscarriage of justice, it is determined and dependent on the peculiar facts and circumstances of a case and the legal duty of proof is on the party alleging that the justice of his case has been miscarried such that it has failed in the case.  The party has to satisfy an appellate Court that from the record of the proceeding conducted by a trialLower Court, it has failed to do justice by use of a procedure that would make what happened, in the proper sense, not a judicial procedure, thereby reaching an unfavourable and unfair outcome in the case.  Has the Appellant demonstrated from the record that there was and it indeed suffered a miscarriage of justice in the circumstances of the case? As shown before now, all that the Appellant said in the Brief is that it suffered a miscarriage of justice by reason of the Lower Courts non-compliance with the provisions of Section 2941 along a failure to hear the motion of 4th April, 2017 and breach of principles governing summary judgment.  On the non-compliance with the provisions of Section 2941, the law as pointed out in the judicial authorities cited on the point, non-compliance alone; without more, does not constitute miscarriage to nullify a decision, under the provision of Section 2945.The failure to hear the Appellants motion of 4th April, 2017, on its part, is the Appellants separate and distinct issue 1 in the appeal.  As for the alleged breach by the Lower Court of the principle governing summary judgment, the Appellant did not demonstrate how or in what manner the alleged breach occurred or happened from the record of the proceedings.  The Apex Court, has given an insight into what may constitute a miscarriage of justice in respect of non-compliance with the provision of Section 2941 and the duty of a party alleging it to prove same before an appellate Court. In Akoma v. Osenwokwu supra, Galadima, JSC, in the lead judgment stated, at page 489 of the Report, that: - Firstly, the fact that Section 2941 of the 1999 Constitution makes it mandatory for a Court to deliver it judgment within 90 days after final address, and that by Section 294 5 of the same Constitution, a judgment will not be invalidated or nullified for non-compliance unless and until the appellate Court considering such a complaint on appeal is fully satisfied that the appellant has shown that it had suffered a miscarriage of justice by such late delivery of judgment. Further, the fact that in determining whether a miscarriage of justice was occasioned due to inordinate delay, the emphasis is not the length of time simpliciter, but on the effect it produced in the mind of the Court, such as if the delay is found to have obviously [affected] the Courts perception, appreciation and evaluation of the cases and that it is one the Court would readily interfere.  In this appeal, the Appellant did not even make any attempt to show that the delay in delivering the Ruling in question, in fact, affected the Lower Courts perception, appreciation and assessment or evaluation of the documentary evidence before it in the Respondents motion for summary judgment. What is more, the Appellant here did not say and prove that the delay in delivering the Ruling was, in the circumstances of the case, inordinate so as to have had any negative effect on the Lower Courts perception, appreciation and assessment of the evidence placed before it in the motion.  In fact, from the Record of Appeal and the account given by the Learned Counsel for the Appellant, the Ruling was to have been delivered on the 30th May, 2018, but was delivered on the 7th June, 2018; a period of about eight 8 days later. Worthy of note, is the fact that no witnesses testified at the hearing of the Respondents motion for judgment and only Affidavit evidence and written addresses were placed before the Lower Court and considered by it in the Ruling.  So the demeanour and credibility of witnesses did not arise for assessment and evaluation in the Ruling for any delay in the delivery of the Ruling to have had any reasonable effect on the Lower Courts perception, appreciation and evaluation of their evidence. Even if there were witnesses who gave oral evidence, the period of delay could not have, in the absence of proof by the Appellant, reasonably impaired the Lower Courts vision, perception and proper appraisal of their evidence in the course of the Ruling, since in addition; there was the Affidavit evidence along with the Exhibits attached thereto, to be considered.  In the result, for the above reasons, the Appellants argument on issue 3 are bereft of merit as it has failed to satisfactorily show that it suffered any sort of real miscarriage of justice for reason of non-compliance with the provisions of Section 2941 in the delivery of the Ruling by the Lower Court.  The issue is resolved against the Appellant.  Appellants Issue 1: Appellants Submissions:  The arguments are that failure by the Lower Court to hear the Appellants motion of 4th April, 2017 for the case to be referred to the Multi Door Court House LMDC for ADR, before delivering the Ruling on the Respondents motion for summary judgment, was in breach of the Appellants right to fair hearing as guaranteed by Section 36 of the Constitution.  Section 169 of LMDC Law, 2007 [Lagos State]and Order 3, Rule 11 of the [Lagos State High Court] Civil Procedure Rules, 2012 2012 Rules were referred to and it is submitted that the Lower Court has a duty to refer the case to the Multi Door Court House as it was registeredmarked IDADR2322016, in accordance with its Rules which are binding, on the authority of South Atlantic Pet. Limited v. Ministry of Petroleum Resources 2013 LPELR-21892 SC. Duru v. FRN 2013 28-WRN, 1 @ 18 SC, Nwankudu v. Ibeto 2010 LPELR-4391 CA and Afro Continental Nigeria Limited v. Co-operative Associate of Professionals Inc. 2003 LPELR-217 SC were cited for the argument of breach of the Appellants right to fair hearing and it is further contended that the failure to hear the Appellants motion is contrary to the principle of law that a Court must hear every application and give a decision as stated in Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlted v. Monokpo 2003 LPELR-1886 SC, among other cases.  The Court is urged to resolve the issue in favour of the Appellants as it has shown that its right to fair hearing has been breached.  Respondents Submission:- Citing Ika Local Government Area v. Mba 2007 12 NWLR Pt. 1049 679, it is said that fair hearing is based on the objective view or opinion of a reasonable person who watched the proceedings of a Court whether in his opinion, justice was done to the parties. It is then submitted by Learned Counsel that it is not correct that the Lower Court did not decide the Appellants motion of 4th April, 2017, and page 139 of the Record of Appeal was referred to where the Lower Court decided the said motion on the 23rd of May, 2017 when the Learned Counsel for the Appellant absented himself. In further argument, counsel for the Respondent said the Appellants Counsel had a duty to keep abreast of the proceeding after absenting himself in the course thereof, on the authority of Afonja Comm. Bank Nigeria Limited v. Akpan 2001 LPELR-6958 CA. The cases cited for the Appellant on the issue are said to be inapplicable to the facts of the Appellants case since the motion of 4th April, 2017 was decided before delivering of the Ruling appealed against. Pages 140, 142 and 143-9 of the Record of Appeal were cited and Section 361 of the 1999 Constitution set out, said to have been upheld in the case of First Alstate Sec. Ltd v. Adesoye H. Ltd 2013 16 NWLR Pt. 1381 470 @ 494 whose facts are said to be almost similar to the instant appeal wherein a party mis-used the constitutional provisions. On the authority of Chidoka v. F.C.F.C. 2013 5 NWLR Pt. 1346 144 @ 162, it is submitted that a party who failed to use an opportunity to present his case cannot later complain of denial of fair hearing. According to Learned Counsel, the Appellant who refused or failed to file a defence in the case of the Respondent which was an ADR matter merely employed delay tactics to deny the Respondents entitlement for over a year.  The Court is urged to hold that the Appellant cannot be heard to cry of denial of the right to fair hearing since it was granted ample opportunity by the Lower Court.  Resolution: The constitutionally guaranteed right to fair hearing in the determination of the civil rights and obligations of a personparty by a Court of law or other tribunal established by law, is a fundamental one of substance the breach or denial of which, by established judicial principles of law, would vitiate the entire proceedings of such a Court or other tribunal from the beginning to the end. It is a right that the law says cannot be waived or statutorily taken away from a party to judicial proceedings on the authority of, inter alia, Bamgboye v. University of Ilorin 1999 10 NWLR Pt. 622 290, Awoniyi v. Registered Trustees, Rose Order, AMORC Nigeria 2000 6 SC Pt. 1 103, Agbogu v. Adichie 2003 2 NWLR Pt. 805 509, Okafor v. Attorney General, Anambra State 1991 3 NWLR Pt. 200 59, Araka v. Ejeagwu 2001 5 WRN, 1, Ovunwo v. Woko 2011 6 MJSC Pt. III 83, Gitto Construction Generali Nigeria Limited v. Etuk 2013 LPELR-20817 CA, Otapo v. Sunmonu 1987 1 NWLR Pt. 58 587. The law is also settled that a Court of law has the judicial and judicious duty to hear and pronounce on all pending applications or motions properly and duly brought before it in the course of proceedings, hearing or trial of a case and so failure or refusal to do so, would constitute or amount to a breach or denial of the right to fair hearing of the party who filed such applicationmotion. Nwokoro v. Onuma 1990 1 NWLR Pt. 136 22, Nalsa & Team Assoc v. NNPC 1991 8 NWLR Pt. 212 652, Alfa v. Atanda 1993 5 NWLR Pt. 296 729, Newswatch Comm. Limited v. Atta 2006 6 N.S.C.Q.R, 438, United Parcel Service Limited v. Ufot 2006 ALL FWLR Pt. 314 337, FAAN v. Wamal Express Limited 2011 1 MJSC Pt. 11 1105.  The complaint of the Appellant here is that the Lower Court failed or refused to hear its motion of 4th April, 2017 for the case to be referred for ADR, which was pending before delivering the Ruling appealed against.  The Record of Appeal at pages 89-94, shows the Appellants motion of 4th April, 2017 along with the Affidavit and Written Address in support thereof and when the matter came up for hearing on the 23rd May, 2017, page 139 shows the proceedings of the Lower Court on that as follows: - Parties Absent Appearance: Lewis Akanimo with Bayo Yussuf for Claimant. No appearance for Defendant. Mr. Akanimo: I spoke to the Defendants Lawyer and he said he will send someone, I am surprised he is not here. COURT: The Defendant has filed an Application for the Court to refer the matter to ADR. The Application is superfluous, it is already an ADR matter. I will advise parties to make use of the Lagos Settlement Week in June. Akanimo: We do not really want to go to Mediation; we have explored all avenues of settlement. Going to mediation will be futile. COURT: In the circumstances, I will direct that the Defendant file his Statement of Defence and Counter Affidavit to the Motion for judgment.  Clearly, from this record, which binds the parties and Court; see Gwandu v. COP, Kebbi State 2006 ALL FWLR Pt. 1294 529, Gamu v. Hausa 2006 ALL FWLR Pt. 293 378, Sapo v. Sunmonu 2010 11 NWLR Pt. 1203 374, the learned Counsel for the Appellant was aware of the proceedings of that day, promised to send someone but eventually failedrefused to do so or appear in the case. In the circumstances, the Lower Court was right and properly proceeded with the matter in the absence of the Counsel for the Appellant who opted and chose to stay away from the Court by being absent without the courtesy of any communication to that Court to excuse the absence. Gbagi v. Okpoko 2014 4 NWLR Pt. 1396 136, Maduike v. Tetelis Nigeria Limited 2016 6 NWLR Pt. 1509 619.  The underlined portion of the above proceeding of the Lower Court leaves no doubt that the Appellants motion of 4th April, 2017 which sought for the case against it to be referred to ADR was effectively, completely and finally determineddecided by the Lower Court when it emphatically stated that: - The application is superfluous, it is already an ADR matter. I will advise parties to make use of the Lagos Settlement Week in June.  After this decision and in consequence of the position of the Learned Counsel for the Respondent, the Lower Court directed the Appellant to file its statement of Defence and Counter Affidavit to the motion for judgment and then, adjourned the matter to 27th September, 2017 for further directions.  The Record of Appeal reproduced above has frontally debunked the claim by the Appellants learned Counsel that the Lower Court did not determine the motion of 4th April, 2017 for the matter to be referred to ADR before the Ruling appealed against, was delivered.  It may be recalled that I have stated earlier that the Learned Counsel for the Appellant was aware of the proceedings of the Lower Court on the 23rd May, 2017, but chose not to appear or send another counsel as he promised, to represent the Appellant at the hearing whereat, the motion of 4th April, 2017 was determined by the Lower Court. Since the Appellants counsel was afforded the opportunity to be presented and be heard at the proceedings, but decided not utilize it, the Appellant, cannot now claim to have been denied a fair hearing on the ground that the said motion was not heard before the Ruling appealed against was delivered.  Perhaps, I should point out that the Appellant who was directed on 23rd May, 2017 to file its Statement of Defence and Counter Affidavit, to the motion for summary judgment, was represented by Counsel from thence up to the 7th une, 2018 when the Ruling was delivered, but did not comply or take any step to comply with the directive.  The exhortation of Tobi, JSC, in the case of Adebayo v. A. G., Ogun State 2008 7 NWLR Pt. 1085 201 cited in the Respondents Brief on the penchant for the mis-use of the principle of fair hearing by Counsel in deliberate attempt to delay and eventually frustrate expeditious, disposaldetermination undefendable cases, is quite apt and pungent here. In his very weighty voice, His lordship had stated that: - Learned Counsel for the appellant roped in the fair hearing principle. I have seen in recent time that parties who have bad cases embrace and make use of the constitutional provisions of fair hearing to bamboozle the adverse party and the Court, with a view to moving the Court away from the live issues in litigation. They make so much weather and sing the familiar song that the constitutional provision is violated or contravened. They do not stop there. They raise the defence in the most inappropriate cases because they have nothing to canvas in favour of their case. The fair hearing provisions in the Constitution is the machinery or locomotive of justice, not a spare part to propel or invigorate the case of the user. It is not a casual principle of law available to a party to be picked up at will in a case and force the Court to apply it to his advantage. On the contrary, it is a formidable and fundamental provision available to a party who is really denied fair hearing because he was not heard or that he was not properly heard in the case. Let the litigants who have nothing useful to advocate in favour of their cases leave the fair hearing constitutional provision alone because it is not available to them just for the asking.  In the earlier case of Newswatch Comm. Ltd. v. Atta 2006 4 SC Pt. II 114, 2006 12 NWLR Pt. 993 144, His lord stated that: - Counsel, quite a legion, find the fair hearing principle duly entrenched in the Constitution as a pathway to success whenever they are in trouble on the merit of the case before the Court. Some resort to it as if it is a magic wand to cure all ills of the litigation. A good number of counsel resort to the principle even when it is inapplicable in the case. The Constitutional principle of fair hearing is for both parties in litigation. It is not only for one of the parties. In other words, fair hearing is not a one-way but a two-way traffic in the sense that it must satisfy a double carriage-way, in the context of both the plaintiff and the defendant or both the appellant and the respondent. The Court must not invoke the principle in favour of one of the parties to the disadvantage of the other party undeservedly. The fair hearing principle formerly entrenched in Section 33 of the 1979 Constitution, and now Section 36 of the 1999 Constitution, is not for the weakling, the slumberer, the indolent or the lazy litigant, but it is for the party who is alive and kicking in the judicial process by taking advantage of the principle at the appropriate time. The principle is not available to a party who sets a trap in the litigation process against the Court and accuse the Court of assumed wrong doing even when such so-called wrong doing is, as a matter of fact, propelled or instigated by the party, through his Counsel.  The roping of the principle and right to fair hearing by the Counsel for the Appellant who admittedly is indebted to the Respondent, here in an attempt to impugn the Ruling by the Lower Court on the respondents motion for summary judgment, is merely meant and intended to obfuscate the real issue in the case before the Lower Court. The allegation of denial of the Appellants right to fair hearing in respect of the motion of 4th April, 2017 is undoubtedly spurious and untenable on the face of thy Record of Appeal.  The Issue One 1 is devoid of merit and resolved against the Appellant.  Issue Two 2: Appellants Submission: It is submitted that the Respondent did not plead and prove the interest claimed and the Lower Court was wrong to have granted the motion for summary judgment and awarded the sums claimed including the interest. According to Counsel, relying on Ubah v. Fidelity Bank, Plc 2013 LPELR-20657CA, the Lower Court had no jurisdiction to grant the claim of the Respondent for recovery of debt and interest under the summary judgment procedure since same is not within the contemplation of the rules, but ought to have, on the authority of, among other cases, Tom Total Nig. Ltd. v. Skye Bank 2017 LPELR-41953CA; Ferrero & Co. Ltd. v. Henkel Chem. Nig. Ltd 2011 LPELR-12SC and UBA, Plc v. Oranuba 2013 LPELR-20692CA, transferred the matter to the general cause list for the Respondent to prove the interest element claimed. It is contended that in the circumstances, the decision by the Lower Court is perverse since it is against the rules and principles governing summary judgment procedure and reliance was placed on Emmanuel v. Umana 2016 LPELR-40037SC for the argument. Opara v. Diamond Bank, Plc 2011 LPELR-4268CA was cited in support of the call on the Court to set aside the decision of the Lower Court and to resolve the issue in Appellants favour.  Respondents Submissions: A portion of the statement by the Court in Ubah v. Fidelity Bank, Plc supra was set out and it is submitted that the facts of the case do not help the Appellants case since the parties by their agreement, are ad idem on the rate of interest accruable and the Lower Court has a duty to hold parties bound by their agreement. It is also the case of the Respondent that a suit is maintainable under the summary judgment procedure if the claim relates to a debt or liquidated money demand, relying on Nkwo Mkt. Comm. Bank Nig. Ltd. v. Obi 2010 14 NWLR Pt. 1213 169; Maja v. Samouris 2002 3 SC, 37 and Dyeris v. Mobil Oil Nig. Plc 2009 LPELR-8914CA.  In addition, on the authority of Akpan v. A. I. P. I. C. Ltd 2013 LPELR-20081SC, it is submitted that the Respondent established his entitlement to the interest claimed in the Affidavit in support of the motion for judgment, based on the agreement of the parties.  The Court is urged to resolve the issue in Respondents favour and hold that the Lower Court was justified in granting the interest.  Now, the claims by the Respondent which the Lower Court decided in the Ruling of 7th June, 2018 were in paragraphs B, C and D of the Endorsement on the Writ of Summons dated 9th December, 2016 which were repeated in the concluding paragraph of the Statement of Claim of the same date. They are as follows: - B. An Order compelling the Defendant to immediately pay over to the Claimant the sum of N96,572,779 Ninety Six Million, Five Hundred and Seventy Two Thousand, Seven Hundred and Seventy Nine Naira. C. Pre-judgment Interest on the said N96,572,779 Ninety Six Million, Five Hundred and Seventy Two Thousand, Seven Hundred and Seventy Nine Naira at 18% p.a. reckoned from 17th September, 2015 to the date of judgment in this Suit. D. Post Judgment interest on the said N96,572,779 Ninety Six Million, Five Hundred and Seventy Two Thousand, Seven Hundred and Seventy Nine Naira at 10% p.a. reckoned from the date of Judgment in this Suit to the date of full and final liquidation of the Defendants outstanding indebtedness to the Claimant.  It was after the service of the Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim filed by the Respondent on the Appellant and the failurerefusal by the latter to respondreact to the claims by way of a Statement of Defence, that the Respondent filed the Motion of 9th November, 2016 for summary judgment pursuant to the provisions of Order 11, Rules 1 and 52 of the Lower Courts Civil Procedure Rules, 2012 2012 Rules. The provisions are thus: - 1 Where a Claimant believes that there is no defence to his claims, he may file with his Originating Process, the Statement of Claim, list of documents to be relied upon, the depositions of his witnesses and an application for summary judgment which application shall be supported by an affidavit stating the grounds for his belief, and a written brief in respect thereof. 52 Where it appears to a Judge that the Defendant has no good defence the Judge may thereupon enter judgment for a Claimant.  Order 20 1 of the same Rules also provide that: 201 If the claim is only for a debt or liquidated demand, and the Defendant does not within the time allowed for the purpose, file a Defence, the Claimant may, at the expiration of such time, apply for final judgment for the amount claimed with costs.  Admittedly, the Appellant was served with the motion of 9th November, 2019 and, as shown under Issue 1, was even directed by the Lower Court on 23rd May, 2017 to file its Statement of Defence to the action and counter Affidavit to the motion for judgment, which however, CounselAppellant both chose to ignore and disregard throughout the proceedings of the case. What the Lower Court did in the case of the Respondent was completely within and in line with the provisions of Order 11, Rule 1 and 52 as well as Order 201 of its 2012 Rules for summary judgment and default pleadings, respectively. The procedure used, followed, adopted and employed by the Lower Court in the consideration of the Respondents motion of 9th November, 2017 for summary judgment is as provided for in its rules of procedure for such cases and the Appellant has not shown any particular or specific step taken by the Lower Court in the consideration and grant of the said motion that can seriously, be said to be in breach of the procedure. It is not enough or sufficient for a party to make a blanket allegation of the breach or failure by a Court to follow its rules or other principles of law without demonstrating the specific manner in which the rules or principles were offended in the steps taken by the Court in the course of its proceedings. In Order 11 Rule 52, the Lower Court was required to consider the facts placed before it by a Defendant in a case brought under the summary judgment procedure, if any, in order to determine that he has no good defence to the action against him and then proceed to enter judgment for the claimant. In the Appellants case, no defence at all, was filed even after a specific directive by the Lower Court for the Appellant to file a defence to the action so that the case could be determined on its merit, so the Appellant defaulted in filing pleadings in the case, which was a claim for only debt or liquidated demand, thereby automatically, entitled the Respondent to apply for final judgment for the amount claimed with costs under Order 20, Rule 1.  However, the judgment applied for by the Respondent and granted by the Lower Court was a summary judgment; a judgment the law considers on the merit and subject only to an appeal, see N.N.S.C. v. AgricorIncorp. 1991 3 NWLR Pt. 177 109; Mark v. Eke 2004 1 SC Pt. II 1; Uko v. Ekpenyong 2006 All FWLR Pt. 324 1927; Duke v. Akpabuyo LG. 2006 All FWLR Pt. 294 559; Nnabude v. G. N. G. WA Ltd 2010 15 NWLR Pt. 1216 365, and not a default judgment which can be set aside under the provisions of Order 20, Rule 12 of the 2012 Rules.  In ordinary cases, the law is that pre-judgment interest claimed requires to be specifically pleaded and sufficiently proved by a claimant before it can properly be granted or awarded. See Petgas Res. Ltd v. Mbanefo 2006 All FWLR 337; Petroleum Special Trust Fund v. Western Project Consort. Ltd 2007 14 NWLR Pt. 1055 1; Ogbu v. Ani 1994 7 NWLR Pt. 355 128, 1994 7 SCNJ, 383; Jallco Ltd v. Owoniboys Tech. Serv. Ltd 1995 4 SCNJ, 256; Reynolds Const. Co. Ltd v. Rockonoh Prop. Co. Ltd 2005 4 SC, 1, 2005 10 NWLR Pt. 934 15. However, where by agreement or contract, parties expressly agree that interest shall be chargeable and even freely expressed and stipulated the rate of such interest accruable and payable in their transaction, then the Court would look no further than the terms of the agreement by the parties which bind them, for the award of such interest. The express agreement by the parties constitutes sufficient and satisfactory proof that the interest specified and stipulated by them was payable and accruable in the transaction. Mech. Ltd. v. Agility & Brothers Ent. Nig. Ltd 2006 ALL FWLR Pt. 298 1289; International Trust Bank, Plc v. Kautal Hairu Co. Ltd. 2006 ALL FFWLR Pt. 292 116; G. M. O. N. & S. Co. Ltd. v. Akputa 2010 9 NWLR Pt. 1200 443; Okafor v. Eziogu 2011 LPELR-3923 CA; Texaco Oveseas Nig. United v. Pedmar Nig. Ltd 2002 13 NWLR Pt. 785 526; M. H. Nig. Ltd v. Okefiena 2011 6 NWLR Pt. 1244 514.  Furthermore, the summary judgment procedure, which is akin to and like the undefended list procedure, is a unique procedure put in place to enable an expeditious disposal of simple claims for liquidated sum or money demand to which, from the facts presented before the Court, the Defendant either expressly admits indebtedness or has no real defence in law to the claim, without the rigorous of the often, time and resource wasting procedure of a normal trial.  In the procedure, usually, the matter is determined based on the Affidavit evidence placed before a Court by the parties which contain all the relevant and material facts of the claim with specific and sufficient particulars to enable the Court to determine it without the need for oral evidence or proof. As in the Appellants case, where there was an express agreement by the parties that interest was to be chargeable and payable and the rate and other terms of the interest were set out by them and the Appellant did dispute the agreement, but refusedfailed to file any process to react, respond and to defend the claim, the Lower Court had no other option than to enter judgment as provided for and in line with the provision of Order 11, Rule 52 of the 2012 Rules. Since the Appellant did not file pleadings to challenge or controvert the facts contained in the Respondents Statement of Claim and did not also file a Counter Affidavit to dispute and controvert the facts deposed to in the Respondents Affidavit in support of the motion for judgment and so deemed to have admitted all those facts, the issue or question of proof of the interest on the sum or amount claimed did not arise since the law is that a fact admitted requires no further proof. See Section 123 of the Evidence Act 2011; Okesuji v. Lawal 1991 1 NWLR Pt. 170 661; Ajomale v. Yaduat No.2 1991 5 NWLR 191 266; Jikantoro v. Dantoro 2004 5 SC Pt. II 1; Akpa v. State 2008 7 MJSC, 77; Reg. Trustees v. Medical & Health 2008 3 MJSC, 121; NNPC v. Olagbaju 2006 ALL FWLR Pt. 334 1855; Duzu v. Yunusa 2010 10 NWLR Pt. 1201 80.  In the premises of the extant position of the law, the Lower Court was right to have entered summary judgment in the sumamount claimed along with the interest agreed to by the parties as shown in the unchallenged and uncontroverted facts averred and deposed to in the Respondents pleadings and affidavit evidence in support of the motion for judgment. This is the vital and crucial difference between the Appellants case and the general statement of the Court in the Ubah v. Fidelity Bank, Plc supra, heavily and strenuously relied on by the Appellant. Whereas the Court found no iota of evidence establishing that the respective parties were ad idem regarding the rates of interest in the Ubahs case, as demonstrated before now, there was the unchallenged fact and evidence that the parties expressly, freely and voluntarily agreed that interest at the rate of 18% p.a. on the transaction between them was chargeable and payable.  Parties to a contract or agreement, except in recognized situations, are bound by the terms and conditions they freely chose to govern and regulate their relationship and no Court of law, will allow, permit or encourage any of them to renege or resile from such terms and conditions of the contract or agreement, particularly where they are written in a document, under any pretext. See Okogie v. Epoyin 2010 11 NWLR Pt. 1206 456; JFS Inv. Ltd v. Brawal Line Ltd 2010 18 NWLR Pt. 1225 495; Kaydee Ventures Ltd. v. Min., FCT 2010 7 NWLR Pt. 1192 171; Larmie v. D. P. M. & S. Ltd 2006 ALL FWLR Pt. 296 775, 2005 12 SC Pt. 1 93; A. G., Rivers State v. A. G., Akwa Ibom State 2011 3 MJSC, 1.  In the result, I find no merit in the arguments of the Appellant on the issue and it is resolved against it.  On the whole, with the resolution of all the three 3 Issues raised for determination in the appeal against the Appellant, the appeal is left devoid of merit and bound to fail.  The appeal is in consequence, dismissed for lacking in merit and the Ruling delivered by the Lower Court on the 7th June, 2018 entering summary judgment in favour of the Respondent, is hereby affirmed in its entirety.  The Respondent is entitled to costs for prosecuting the appeal which the Court assesses at Five Hundred Thousand Naira N500,000.00 to be paid by the Appellant.   JOSEPH SHAGBAOR IKYEGH, J.C.A.:  I am in full agreement with the lucid judgment prepared by my learned brother, Mohammed Lawal Garba, J.C.A. Hon. P.J., which I had the privilege of reading in draft.   TIJJANI ABUBAKAR, J.C.A.:  I had the privilege of reading in draft the leading Judgment prepared and rendered in this appeal by my Learned brother GARBA, JCA. I am in full agreement with the reasoning and conclusion and adopt the Judgment as my own. I have nothing extra to add. I join my brother in holding that the appeal is devoid of merit and therefore deserves to be and is hereby dismissed by me. I also affirm the Ruling delivered by the lower Court on the 7th day of June, 2018. I abide by the consequential orders made including the order on costs. -end! " ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  ISAIAH OLUFEMI AKEJU, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  This appeal is against the Judgment of the Federal High Court holden at Yenagoa Bayelsa State delivered on the 14th day of November, 2019 in Suit No FHCYNGCS1002019 commenced by the 1st Respondent through the originating summons filed on 18919 with the supporting affidavit and documents for declaratory and injunctive reliefs as on pages 163 - 1252 of Vol. 1 of the Record of proceedings. In the judgment now on appeal, the lower Court had nullified the entire primary election of the 2nd Respondent held on 4th September, 2019 in Bayelsa State.  The Appellant and the 1st Respondent are members of the 2nd Respondent a political party, the All Progressive Congress, and it is mutually accepted by parties in this appeal that the appellant and the 1st Respondent contested the Governorship primary election conducted by the 2nd Respondent on 4th September, 2019 to nominate its candidate for the 2019 election to the office of governor of Bayelsa State, and at the end of the primary election the Appellant was announced as the winner thereof. Being dissatisfied with such announcement or declaration, the 1st Respondent commenced the suit No FHCYNGCS1002019 at the Federal High Court, Yenagoa hereinafter called the lower Court challenging the return of the Appellant.  At the lower Court, the Appellant contested by way of applications the jurisdiction of the Court on ground that the action was statute barred among other challenges. The lower Court heard and overruled the applications and nullified the entire primary election of the 2nd Respondent for non-compliance with the relevant laws and Guidelines.  Being dissatisfied with the decision of the lower Court, the Appellant commenced this appeal and in the Appellants’ Brief of Argument filed on 271119 and endorsed by M. J. Nduma Esq., who also adopted same at the hearing of the appeal, the Appellant raised issues for determination as follows: 1. Whether by virtue of Section 2859 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the 1st Respondent’s Originating Summons filed on 18919 challenging the primary election of the 2nd Respondent held on the 4th day of September, 2019 was not statute barred thereby divesting the Court of jurisdiction. 2. Whether or not the trial Court was right when it held that the voluntary personal undertaking of an aspirant in the primary election of a political party is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended and the 2nd Respondent is not bound by his voluntary undertaking in the nomination form he filled before he was cleared to participate in the primary of the 2nd Respondent. 3. Whether or not the trial Court erred in law when it failed to order for pleadings despite the existence of hearsay deposition, highly contentious facts and conflicting depositions in the affidavits exchanged by the parties before the trial Court. 4. Whether or not the trial Court was right to have raised issues suo motu and resolved same without affording the parties the opportunity to address the Court on them.  In the Brief of the 1st Respondent settled by F.O. Olorogun and filed on 3121, the three issues for determination are; 1. Whether the lower Court was not right in holding that the suit of the 1st Respondent was not statute barred. 2. Whether the lower Court was not right when it held that the undertaking signed by the 1st Respondent in his nomination form does not prevent the 1st Respondent from exercising his statutory right to seek redress in Court as provided in Section 879 of the Electoral Act 2010 as amended. 3. Whether having regards to the facts and circumstances of this case, the lower Court was not right when it declined to order pleadings in the case.  Thus both the Appellant and the 1st Respondent argued the issue of jurisdiction as their first issue, and being a threshold issue, the issue will be taken and determined first in this appeal. The other parties did not file briefs while the Appellant filed a Reply Brief on 51219.  The contention of the appellant on this issue is that by virtue of Section 2859 of the Constitution 4th Alteration Act No. 21 2017 the Respondent’s Originating Summons filed at the lower Court on 18th November to challenge the outcome of the primary election held by the 2nd Respondent on 4919 which declared the Appellant winner of the election was incompetent having been filed outside the constitutionally prescribed period of 14 days from the date the cause of action arose.  It was contended that by the decision in F.R.I.N. v. GOLD 2007 ALL FWLR PT.380 1444, the document to examine to ascertain the date of occurrence of a cause of action is the Originating process and when it was filed. It was contended that the case of the 1st Respondent arose by virtue of the outcome of the primary election of 2nd Respondent held on 41119 and the declaration of the appellant as the winner thereof, therefore the cause of the 1st Respondents action occurred on 4th day of September, 2019 and not on 7th day of September, 2019 while the 1st Respondent would have filed his suit within 14 days from the date of occurrence.  It was contended that the Originating Summons in this case was filed on 18th September, 2019 as admitted by the Respondent, but the Court, without calling for address by the parties tended to find differently which finding rendered the whole decision a nullity. It was contended that the trial Court erred in law when it agreed with the 1st Respondent that the cause of action arose of the 7th of November, 2019 when the name of the Appellant was submitted to the 3rd Respondent as the doctrine of continuous injury does not apply to election matters in which time begins to run once the cause of action accrues; INEC v. OGBADIBO LOCAL GOVERNMENT & ORS 2015 LPELR 4839 SC.  The learned counsel submitted that the decision in BELLO v. YUSUFF & ORS 2019 5 NWLR PT.1695 250 is quite illuminating on the consideration of when cause of action arises and when time begins to run for the filing of election matters.  It was submitted that in the computation of time election matters, the Interpretation Act excluding the day of the act does not apply; OKECHUKWU v. INEC 2014 17 NWLR PT.14366 255; PDP v. INEC 2014 LPELR 23808 SC.  In the argument of this point under its own issue number one, the 1st Respondent’s Brief, the learned counsel for 1st Respondent submitted that the lower Court was endowed with jurisdiction to entertain the action because it was not statute barred. According to the learned counsel, in the determination of whether a suit is caught by limitation law and thus statute barred, the date of the accrual of the cause of action and the date the action was commenced in Court are crucial as found on the Originating Summons while the date the action was filed is as stated on the processes filed in Court; AMUSAN v. OBIDEYI 2005 14 NWLR PT.945 322.  As submitted by the learned counsel, cause of action is defined as denoting every fact which is necessary for a plaintiff to prove if traversed to support his right to the judgment of the Court; IYEKE v. PETROLEUM TRAINING INSTITUTE 2019 2 NWLR PT. 1656 217. It was submitted that the totality of the plaintiff’s claim, in an action commenced by Originating summons the affidavit of the parties take the place of the pleadings; NNPC v. FAMFA OIL LTD 201217 NWLR PT.1328 144; AGBAKOBA v. INEC 2008 18 NWLR PT. 1119 489. It was submitted that the paragraphs of the affidavit or pleadings must be read together to discover the cause of action; NGIGE v. OBI 200618 NWLR PT. 9991; GUKAS v. JOS INTERNATIONAL BREWERIES LTD 19916 NWLR PT. 199614; ADEGBOYEGA v. AWE 1993 3 NWLR PT. 280224.  The learned counsel urged that paragraphs 30, 36 and 37 of the Affidavit in support of the Originating Summons and Paragraph 381 of the Further and Better Affidavit in support of the originating summons must be read together so as to discover the cause of action in the instant case, which are that the primary election was held on 4th September, 2019 and the Appellant was wrongly returned as the winner thereof against the 1st Respondent whereof the 1st Respondent protested the conduct of the election and return of the appellant as the winner thereof to the Election Appeal Committee of the 2nd Respondent whose finding was not favourable to the 1st Respondent as the 2nd Respondent went ahead to submit the name of the Appellant to the 3rd Respondent on the 7th September, 2019, and from the foregoing, the cause of action in this case crystallized on the 7th September, 2019, a fact that was rightly affirmed by the lower Court in its judgment at pages 2949-2950 of Vol. 3 of the Record of Appeal.  The learned counsel contended that the contention of the Appellant that the cause of action arose on 4th September, 2019 when the primary election was conducted and not on 7th September, 2019 and therefore the action is statute barred is not correct.  Thus from the arguments of the Appellants and the 1st Respondent on this issue, it is mutually agreed that the primary election which is the crux of the case at the lower Court was held on 4th September, 2019 and the result of the election was announced on the same date while the 1st Respondent was also declared the winner thereof. The Appellant had at the lower Court sought inter alia, the relief of a “Declaration that the Plaintiff having scored the highest number of the valid votes cast at the primary election held by the 1st Defendant and monitored by the 3rd Defendant on 4th September, 2019 is accordingly the validly elected candidate of the 1st Defendant and therefore stands nominated to the 3rd Defendant as the gubernatorial candidate of the 1st Defendant in the 2019 Bayelsa State Governorship Election slated for November, 16, 2019 or any other date subsists.”  The actual issues herein border on what the cause of action is in this case and when it accrued; when does time start to run and what period did the Plaintiff at the lower Court have to file his action; and whether it was not statute barred.  The position of the law as emphasized through the decisions of the Apex Court as well as this Court is that election matters are sui generis and that unlike the other Civil matters time is of essence therein. See HASSAN v. ALIYU 2010 17 NWLR PT. 1223 547. An action is statute barred where such is not commenced within the time stipulated by the law or statute for such commencement. An election or pre-election matter is, by the provisions of Section 285 9 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic or Nigeria 4th Alteration Act, 2017 required to be filed or commenced within 14 days of the occurrence of the event leading to the action. This provision creates a limitation on the filing of election and pre-election matters as any such action not filed within 14 days is statute barred and the Court will not have the jurisdiction to entertain it.  It has been made clear through decision of the Apex Court that in the computation of time for the commencement of an action guided by Section 2859 of the 4th Alteration Act, the provision of the Interpretation Act which excludes the day of occurrence of the act complained of is not excluded and the computation of the period of 14 days include the actual date of such occurrence. See OKECHUKWU v. INEC 2014 17 NWLR PT. 1436255.  In the case that led to this appeal, the complaint of the plaintiff now the 1st Respondent was about the primary election conducted on 4th September, 2019 whereby the computation of time must start from that date, and not on any date thereafter, and by this computation, the claim or action of the 1st Respondent ought to have been filed not later than 17th September, 2019 when the 14 days ended. It therefore becomes clear that the 1st Respondent’s action that was commenced on 18th September, 2019 was filed in violation of the Constitutional provision and therefore statute barred.  Thus undoubtedly, this touches on the jurisdiction of the lower Court to adjudicate in the matter and by implication the jurisdiction of this Court with respect to this appeal. In the case of NNPC v. CLIFCO NIG. LTD20114 MJSC 142, it was held that jurisdiction is very fundamental and a threshold matter of law and when a Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an action or to determine same whatever proceedings conducted therein or decision rendered by that Court becomes an exercise in futility. See also BRONIK MOTORS LTD v. WEMA BANK 1983 1 SCNLR 296.  For the reason of this lack of jurisdiction, this issue must be resolved in favour of the Appellant as no valid proceedings was conducted at the lower Court, and therefore this appeal has nothing to stand upon. It is certain that no one can put something upon nothing and expect it to stand. It must surely collapse.  Having found in favour of the Appellant on this issue of jurisdiction, the remaining issues have become academic and irrelevant to this appeal and I find it unnecessary to consider them. By the same taken, the application argued by the 1st Respondent for the striking out of some grounds of appeal has become otiose and it is discountenanced.  The appeal succeeds and it is allowed consequent upon which the case No. FHCYNGCS1002019 at the lower Court as well as this appeal are struck out.  Parties are to bear their own costs of the appeal.   CORDELIA IFEOMA JOMBO-OFO, J.C.A.:  I read in draft the judgment delivered by my learned brother ISAIAH OLUFEMI AKEJU, JCA.  I agree with his reasoning and conclusion that this appeal has merit and same is allowed by me. The judgment of the Federal High Court sitting in the Yenagoa Judicial Division in suit No.FHCYNGCS1002019 is thus set aside by me also.  I make no order as to costs.   ABUBAKAR MUAZU LAMIDO, J.C.A.:  I agree.-end!  " ;

Delivering the Leading Judgment:  The Appellant, Alhaji Hassan Modu Goba, is not happy with the judgment of the High Court of Justice, Borno State delivered by Hon. Justice A. Z. Musa on the 26th day of May, 2016, where the learned trial judge in his considered judgment after a full trial concluded as follows See page 72 of the Records of Appeal: In view of the above, I am of humble view that the claimant acts of recent possession and ownership to the farmland at Alidawari village neighbouring from the North a bush area, from the East one Goroma, from the West a tree called Sowo by Kanuri language and from the South a bush area appears more probable in favour of the claimant. 1 Therefore, I hereby declared sic that, the claimant is in title sic to the aforementioned farmland situated at Alidawari village neighbouring from the North a bush area, from the East one Goroma, from the West a Tree called Sowo by Kanuri language and from the south a bush area. 2 That perpetual injunction restraining the defendant, his agent, privies or any person claiming through them from entering, claiming, erecting or selling whole or any part of the land, hereby granted; and 3 Cost of the suit: parties to bear their costs.  The foregoing is predicated on the claim of the Respondent as Plaintiff before the trial Court against the Appellant as defendant contained in paragraph 16 of the statement of claim. The claim goes thus: “PARAGRAPH 16 Whereof the Claimant is claiming for the following: a. A declaration that he is the lawful owner of the parcel of land situate at Alidawari village. b. An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendant by himself or his privy or agent and servant from any act of trespassing in or above the aforesaid land. c. Cost of the suit.\"   The fact of the case as can be garnered from the record of Appeal is that the Respondent who was the plaintiff before the trial Court claimed to have purchased plots of land at a place described as Alidawari village in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State in 2003 and 2004 at a cost of N20,000.00 and N40,000.00 respectively from Alhaji Audu. He claimed to have farmed on the land for 5 years. After he gave the land to Lawan Musa to farm on it. Musa used it for two years and handed back the land to him. When insurgence broke out in Borno State, he left the land because he could no longer farm on the land till when there is relative peace. He started clearing the said land and he noticed the appellant trespassing into the land by demarcating the land and dividing it into various plots. He challenged the appellant and when he noticed that the appellant would not yield and leave the land and was insisting that he inherit the land from his father, the Respondent decided to approach the Court claiming those reliefs vide paragraph 16 of his statement of claim herein before reproduced.  Miffed by the outcome of the trial wherein the trial Court entered judgment in favour of the RespondentPlaintiff hence this appeal which is predicated on the notice of appeal dated 29th day of June 2016 and filed on same date.  The grounds of appeal minus the particulars are 1 The learned trial Court erred in law in granting judgment to the Respondent when he could not prove ownership by sale. 2 The learned trial Court erred in law in holding that the Respondent was claiming his title through traditional evidence. 3 The learned trial Court erred in law in granting judgment to the Respondent when he could not establish identity of the land.  Upon the transmission of the Record of Appeal on 30th October, 2017 and which was deemed as properly compiled and transmitted on 31st October, 2018 vide the order of this Court, respective Counsel filed and exchanged their brief of argument.  The Appellants brief of argument dated 7th January, 2019 was filed on 8th day of January 2019. Same was deemed as properly filed and served on the 6th day of May, 2019.  In the said brief, the following issues were presented for the determination of the Appeal: APPELLANT'S ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION 1 Whether the Trial Court was correct in declaring title to the Respondent when he did not prove his case. 2 Whether the trial Court was correct to have held the Respondents claim was based on traditional title. 3 Whether the Respondent has established identity of the land in dispute.  On behalf of the Respondent, the following lone issue was presented for the determination of this Appeal. Whether or not the Respondent has proved his title to the land in dispute.  I have carefully read and compared the issues presented by respective Counsel for the determination of this Appeal. In my candid view, the three issues formulated by the Appellant are contending whether or not the Respondent has proved his case and whether the learned trial judge has properly considered and evaluated the evidence before it in coming to the conclusion reached. In the light of the foregoing, I consider the lone issue presented by the respondent more probable in the circumstance, even though it has its shortcomings. For that reason, I will adopt the issue formulated by the Respondent but redrafted thus: Whether or not the Respondent has proved his title to the disputed land and whether the learned trial judge has properly evaluated the evidence adduced before coming into the conclusion reached.  The argument of the Appellant is that the claim of the Respondent before the trial Court is based on ownership by way of sale. He contended that in a declaration of title to land, the duty is squarely on the Respondent as claimant to discharge the burden of proof placed on him. He added that the burden of proof is on the claimant and where he is able to establish his case by way of credible evidence, only then will he be entitled to the declaration of title sought. He relied on the following cases: NIKAGBATSE v. OPUYE 2010 14 NWLR PT. 1213 51 at 62  63, KODILINYE v. ODU 1935 3 WACA 336 reiterating the fact relied upon by the Respondent that he purchased the land in dispute in 2003 and 2004 respectively, and the agreements to the transaction tendered as Exhibits PW1A and PW1B. He contended that in identifying the land, the Respondent pleaded that the land is situate at Alidawari but Exhibit PW1A and PW1B shows that the land is in Maina Bukarti and Femari. By this, he argued that the Respondent has not identified the land he is claiming. Further to the forgoing, he argued that the agreements on the land at Alidawari were never tendered. He also contended that the Respondent failed to call Lawan Musa and Assu Sulamanti whom he claimed he gave the land to farm, even though he filed their respective witness statement on Oath. He also referred to page 70, lines 1- 16 of the judgment of the trial Court where he claimed the Court held that Exhibit PW1A, PW1B and PW1C do not support the Respondents case. He submitted that the law is that where there is no evidence in proof of declaration of title to land, the claim must fail. He relied on the case of OLADIPO v. MOBA 2010 5 NWLR PT.1186 117 at 126. He argued further that a party who relies on a document in proof of his title to land must tender the document in evidence. He relied on the case of ADELAJA v. ALADE 1999 6 NWLR PT.608 544, JIAZA v. BAMGBOSE 1999 7 NWLR PT. 610 182. For the foregoing he argued that the case of the Respondent ought to have been dismissed but rather the Court made a U-turn and relied on evidence of traditional history. He referred to page 71 lines 24 - 25 of the record of Appeal. He submitted that there is no issue or claim of declaration of title based on traditional history of the case of the Respondent that he purchased the land in dispute. He relied on the case of AKOMAH v. EKE 1966-1979 VOL 6 Oputa Law Reports Oputa L. R. Pg 1 at 7 para B  D. He contended that the time the Respondent purchased the land which is about 10 or 11 years before he instituted the action does not quality as one of traditional history or evidence. He relied on the case of AKOMAH v. EKE SUPRA.  For traditional history to suffice, the claimant must narrate the genealogical tree from the Original owner, the ancestor, in generations appurtenance to his, down the line to the Plaintiff. The Respondent merely stated in paragraph 11 of his statement of claim that the land originates from one Bulama Kachalla who sold the land to Alhaji Audu and or sold same to Musa. He argued that the Respondent failed to prove or adduce evidence on how Bulama Kachalla came to own the land. He relied on the following cases: ODI v. IYALA 2004 8 NWLR PT.875 283, EWO v. ANI 2004 3 NWLR PT. 861 610, EZINWA v. AGU 2004 3 NWLR PT. 861 431. IRAWO v. ADEDOKUN 2005 1 NWLR PT. 906 199.  He submitted further that where a partly relies on the traditional evidence, it is not enough for him to plead that he and his predecessor in title had owned or possessed the land from time immemorial, he must indeed go further to plead and prove the following: 1 Who founded the land? 2 How the land was founded and 3 The particulars of the intervening owners through whom he claims.  He relied on the following cases: EZEOKONKWO v. OKEKE 2002 11 NWLR PT. 777 1, DIKE v. OKONKWO 2008 ALL FWLR PT.404 at 1586 A - D. He argued that all the forgoing requirements are lacking in the Respondents case. He added that it further shows that the claim of the Respondent has nothing to do with traditional evidence and hence the trial Court was wrong to have even considered the issue let alone to be the basis of its judgment. Further he argued that traditional history is one of the ways of establishing title to land. A claimant must plead and show who were his ancestors how he came to own and possess the land and how it devolved on him. He relied on the cases of IBIKUNLE v. LAWANI 2007 3 NWLR PT.1022 580 OKOKO v. DAKOLO 2006 14 NWLR PT.1000 401. It is his contention that where a party pleads traditional evidence and fails to prove, he cannot turn around to rely on act of ownership and possession to prove his title to the land. It will also implies that due to his failure there would be nothing on which to found acts of ownership. In such a situation, the Court is bound to dismiss the claim. But in this case the trial Court did exactly the opposite and granted the Respondents claim. He added that the holding of the Court based on acts of recent possession and ownership of the farmland at Alidawari village are faulty, because the evidence adduced and pleaded by the Respondent has nothing to do with traditional history. He argued that the respondent has failed woefully to prove same and therefore this Court has a duty to set aside the judgment of the lower Court.  On whether the Respondent has identified the land in dispute, he argued that in a claim of declaration of title to land, the claimant is to prove the area being claimed so that the land can be identified with reasonable certainty. He submitted that there are two basic requirements in declaration of title: 1 To establish title through one of the five 5 known ways of establishing title. 2 To define an area to which the declaration can be attached.  It is his argument that the claimant must give the exact extent and identity of the land he is claiming and failure to do this will lead to the suit being dismissed. He cited the cases of GBADAMOSI v. DAIRO 2007 3 NWLR PT. 1021 282, ARABE v. ASANLU 1980 5 -7 SC 78, ADENIRAN v. ASHABI 2004 4 NWLR PT.857 375, OTANMA v. YOUDUBAGHA 2006 2 NWLR PT. 964 337.  He added that the Respondent as the claimant was relying on a plan of his land which he attached in his statement of claim. He added that the said plan was tendered and marked as Exhibit PW1C. But when the Court came to judgment, the Court refused to make use of the said plan, but expunged it. It is his contention that the Court was right to have expunged the plan from the record. He relied on the case of BROSSETE NIG. LTD v. ILEMOBOLA LTD 2007 30 N.S.C.D.R. 1169, EBENIGHE v. ACHI 2011 2 NWLR PT.1230 65 at 69. He argued that the Respondent gave a description of the land which he pleaded at paragraph 8 of the statement of claim and also his evidence before the Court courtesy of his statement on Oath para 8 . He added that his description that the land was located at Alidawari and that to the East of the land is a farm belonging to one Goroma, to the West a farm called Sowo in Kanuri language, to the South a bush and to the North also bush. He argued that the dimension of the land is not given, the length or width is also not given and the features on the land is also not given. He submitted that the description given by the Respondent is not sufficient because a surveyor taking the record of those descriptions cannot produce a plan that will show accurately the land to which title is sought to be given. He relied on the following cases. ONWUEGBUNE v. EZE 1966  1979 VOL.6 OPUTA LAW REPORTS Pg. 124 AT 127 PARA D  E, ARE KWADZO v. ADJEI 1944 10 WACA 24. It is his argument that even where a plan was filed, it must not be in conflict with the description given. He cited the case of AMATA v. MODEKWE 1954 14 WACA. Pg 580. It is his case that in the present case the plan filed by the Respondent which was admitted as Exhibit PW 1C was later disregarded by the Court. He added that the description given by the Respondent has no semblance with the plan. The Respondent said he bought the land but did not say that the two plots were merged and therefore, leaving the Court with whether to speculate or not.  According to him, speculation is not the function of a Court of law, Courts deal with hard credible evidence. He relied on the cases of OWE v. OSHINBAJO 1965 1 ALL NLR 72 at 75.  He urged the Court to allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the trial Court and dismiss the claimant Respondents claim before the trial Court.  The Respondent in his reaction to the three issues submitted on the 1st issue that the trial Court was right to hold that he preferred the evidence of the Respondent to that of the Appellant.  He argued that in traditional title, if the identity of the land was established to be his and aver that the origination of the land is from Bulama Kachala who sold the land to Alhaji Audu who also sold same to Musa from whom he acquired title having bought the land from the said Musa who confirmed the root of the originator and which was not contradicted, the Respondent has established his source to the land. On issue of the identity of the land, he referred to his averment that the land was further as attached in the site allocation plan, an annexure 1a which from the North is a bush area and nobody is farming there, from the east is Goroma's farming, from the west a tree called Sowo by Kanuri Language and by the South is also a bush with nobody farming on it too. He referred to page 4 lines 6 - 11 of the record of proceedings and at page 7 paragraph 8 and page 8 line 1  2 of PW1 deposition on Oath which is not challenged.  In view of all the foregoing, he urged the Court to resolve the Issues formulated by the Appellant in favour of the Respondent.  Further to the foregoing, he referred to the testimony of the Defendant as PW1 before the trial Court that he bought the land in 2003 - 2004 and how he farmed on the land for 5 years before he gave it to Lawan Musa who also farmed on it for two years and also to Suleimanti who also farm on the land. See pages 3 lines 20-23 and page 7 para 5 of the PW 1 statement on Oath. He added that the amount he purchased the land remain unchallenged. He referred to the case of OYEMI v. ADELEKE ALL FWLR PT. 476 at 1920 para b-d year of Law report not provided. He argued that the Appellant who claimed that the land belong to his father did not establish how the land was purchased by his father. Rather the Respondent as claimant before the trial Court established the source of his ownership and the particulars and names of successive owners. He relied on the case of DIKE v. OKONKWO 2008 ALL FWLR PT.404 at P. 1586 Para A - D. OYOVBIARE v. OMAMURHOMU 1999 10 NWLR PT.621 P.23 at 32.  It is his contention that the Appellant testified and called 4 witnesses. The Appellant in his testimony as DW1 posited that it was Bazanna that showed him the land in 1993 or 1994 after the demise of his father. This he said took place in about 12years from 1994. At that time, Appellant was about 40 years. At that age he never knew that his father owned the land. Until he was told that his father bought the land in 1968. He added that when the Appellant was asked under cross examination whether his late father bought the land through an agent he declined. He submitted that most of the evidence of the Appellant before the trial Court did not support his defence hence the defence goes to no issue. He submitted that where there is a conflict of traditional history, the best way to test the traditional history is by reference to acts in recent years as established by evidence and by seeing which of the two competing histories is more probable. He referred to the case of ERINLE AND ORS v. ALUKO AND ORS 2013 LPELR - 22157 where it was held that where the evidence of traditional history adduced by both sides are conflicting or divergent as in the instant case, the best approach for the Court to follow is to test the traditional history by reference to the facts in recent years so as to know which of the two conflicting histories is more probable. He rely on the case of KOJO V BONSIE II 1951 1 WLR P.1223 at 1226. He added that the case of the Respondent is more probable and hence the issue should be resolved in favour of the Respondent. On that note, he urged the Court to dismiss the appeal with cost.  The Appellant filed a reply to the argument of the respondent on 3rd April, 2019. Same was deemed as properly filed on 6th May, 2019. I have read through the said reply brief. It is in violation of the provision of Order 19 Rule 5 of the Rules of this Court. Rather for the said reply brief to reply to new issues, if any, as prescribed by the Rules, it is a further argument on the main brief by the appellant, it is trite that the purpose of a reply brief under the Rules of this Court is not to give another or second opportunity to the appellant to argue or provide additional argument in support of the appeal but only to answer or reply new issues raised by the respondent in his brief of argument. It is not a repair kit for the short comings in the appellants brief of argument. See OJO V OKITIPUPA OIL PALM PLC 2001 9 NWLR PT.719 P.679 AT 693, POPOOLA V ADEYEMO1992 8 NWLR 267, ADEBIYI V SORINMADE 2004 ALL FWLR PT.239 933, BASINCO MOTORS LTD V WOERMANN LINE AND ANOR 200913 NWLR PT.1157 140 BERNARD OJEIFO LONGE V FIRST BANK OF NIGERIA PLC 2010 NWLR PT.1189 1. A reply brief is also not an opportunity to re-emphasize the arguments in the Appellants brief. See NWANKWO OGUANUHU AND ORS v. DR. EMMANUEL I. CHIEBOKA 2013 LPELR 1980, ALHAJI SANI ABUBAKAR DANLADI v. BARR. NASIRU AUDU DANGIRI AND ORS. 2014 LPELR -24020. Therefore, the reply brief by the Appellant is discountenanced.  Having said these, I will proceed with my consideration of the issue formulated. It is the law that in a claim for a declaration of title to land the standard of proof required of the plaintiff is on a balance of probabilities, see ADEREMI V ADERIBE 1960 N.M.C.R 400 at 402,  PAUL NWADIKE & ORS V CLETUS IBEKWE & ORS 1987 NWLR PT.67 718. It is also the law that in a claim for declaration of title, the plaintiff must succeed on the strength of its own case and not on the weakness of the defence even though any evidence adduced by the defence which is favourable to the plaintiffs case will go to strengthen the case for the plaintiff. See RABIATU ADEBAYO AND ORS V RASHEED SHOGO 2005 7 NWLR PT.925 467, FRIDAY ELEMA & ANOR V PRINCESS CHRISTY A. AKENZUA 2000 LPELR  1112, LAMULATU SHASI AND ANOR V MADAM SHADIA SMITH & ORS 200918 NWLR PT.1173 330, SHITTU V FASHAWE 2005 14 NWLR PT.946 671, THOMAS NRUAMAH AND ORS V REUBEN EBUZOEME AND ORS 2013 LPELR -19771, ADEKANMBI V JANGBON2007 ALL FWLR PT.383 152 at 160.  In the light of the foregoing, the pertinent question is whether or not the Respondent as plaintiff before the trial Court has established his claim. In order to answer this question, recourse has to be made to the available evidence by the respondent before the trial Court. The evidence of the plaintiff as posited by PW1, the Respondent is that he purchased the land in 2003 and 2004 respectively at the cost of N20,000.00 and N40,000.00 respectively from Musa who also purchased the land from Alhaji Audu. It is his case that Alhaji Audu purchased the land from Alhaji Bulama Kachalla. See page 17 line 17-19 and page 8 paragraphs 12 of the record of appeal. For the description of the land, see annexure 1a page 4 lines 6-11, page 7 paragraph 8 and page 8 lines 1-2 of the record. It is the evidence of the respondent before the trial Court that the said land is bounded from the North by bush area and nobody is farming there, to the east, one Goroma is farming. To the West, there is a tree called Sowo by Kanuri language and to the South is also a bush. See page 4 lines 6-11, page 7 paragraph 8, page 8 lines 1-2, it is also the case of the Respondent that he farmed on the land for 5 years and gave the land to Lawan Musa who also farmed on the land for 2 years and Suleimanti to farm. These pieces of evidence are not debunked by the Appellant. It is trite that an unchallenged and uncontradicted evidence should be accepted and acted upon by the Court. See the cases of LAWAL v. UTC NIG PLC 2005 13 NWLR PT.934 P. 601, APROFIM ENG CONST. LTD v. SIDOV LTD 2006 13 NWLR PT.996 P. 73, LEADWAY ASSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED v. ZECO NIG. LTD 2004 11 NWLR PT.884 316, MOSHOOD ADELAKUN v. NURUDEEN ORUKU 2006 11 NWLR PT.992 PG.625, MILITARY GOVERNOR OF LAGOS STATE AND ORS v. ADEBAYO ADEYIGA AND ORS. 2012 LPELR  7836.  It is the law that to proof ownership to land there exists five recognized methods. They are: 1 Proof by traditional evidence 2 Proof by production of document of title. 3 Proof by act of ownership extending over a sufficient length of time, numerous and positive enough as to warrant the inference that the person exercising such acts are the owner of the land. 4 Proof by acts of long possession. 5 Proof by possession of connected or adjacent land in circumstances rendering it probable that the owner of such land would in addition be the owner of the land in dispute. See the following cases: IDUNDUN v. OKUMAGBA 1976 9 AND 10 SC 277, at 246 - 250, SUNDAY PIARO v. CHIEF TENALO AND ORS 1976 12 SC 31 at 41 - 43, MOSES UZOCHUKWU AND ORS v. MADAM AMAGHALU ERI AND ORS. 1997 LPELR- 3454, LASISI MORENIKEJI AND ORS v. LALEKE ADEGBOSIN AND ORS. 2003 LPELR-1911. It is also the law that proof of any of the five ways will suffice, see CHIEF ADEYEMI LAWSON v. CHIEF AYO AJIBULU 1997 LPELR  1766, OSAYEMWENRE AMAYO v. OSAYANDE ERINMWINGBOVO 2006 11 NWLR PT.992 699, EWO v. ANI 2004 17 NSCQR 36,NDUKUBA v. IZUNDU 2007 1 NWLR PT. 1016 PG. 432, FRANCIS ADESINA AYANWALE v. OLUMUYIWA OLUMIDE ODUSAMI 2011 LPELR- 8143.  It is on record that the Appellant through his evidence and pleading asserted that he purchased the land in 2003 and 2004 and named his vendor to be Musa. He went further that Alhaji Audu sold the land to Musa and that Alhaji Audu purchased same land from Bulama Kachala.  It is also the case of the Respondent that he purchased the land for N20,000.00 and N40,000.00 respectively. Where land is sold, money is paid and receipt are issued, the purchaser has an equitable interest having gone into possession. What I am saying is that payment of purchase price coupled with being in possession confers an equitable title, see L. B. FOLARIN v. OYEWOLO DUROJAIYE 1988 NWLR PT. 70 351, ALHAJA MORIYAMO ADESANYA v. ADETAYO OLAITAN OTUEWU & ORS 1993 1 NWLR PT.270 414, GODWIN NSIEGBE AND ANOR v. OBINNA MGBEMENA AND ANOR 2007 LPELR  2065.   There is that unchallenged evidence of the Respondent that he purchased the land from a named person and for a disclosed amount of money, comparing all the foregoing with the evidence of the Appellant which in the main is to the effect that his father never told him that he purchased any land, but it was one Bazanna who showed the land to him in 1993 or 1994 after the demise of his father. These pieces of evidence suggests to me that the fact relied upon by the Appellant is that as related to him by Bazanna. To me, the piece of evidence is contaminated by the virus of an hearsay which cannot be relied upon. For the foregoing therefore, I have no option than to come to the irresistible conclusion that the Respondents evidence before the trial Court on ownership of the land in dispute is preponderant. This also buttress the fact that the trial Courts reasoning for coming into the conclusion reached is a product of proper evaluation of evidence placed before the trial Court. It is not the business of this Courts having regard to the fact of this case as disclosed in the record of Appeal to substitute its own view for that of the trial Court. I accordingly so hold. See JOHN ONISILE v. OJO APO 2013 LPELR- 22330, CONGRESS FOR PROGRESSIVE CHANGE v. INDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION AND ORS. 2011 LPELR- 8257., ATOLAGBE v. SHORUN 1985 1 NWLR 360, AGBONIFO v. AIWEREOBA 1988 1 NWLR at 325, AGBI v. OGBEH 2006 11 NWLR PT.990 65, CHITRA KNITTING AND WEAVING MANUFACTURING COMPANY LIMITED v. G. O AKINGBADE 2016 LPELR- 40437.  For all the foregoing, I resolve the lone issue against the Appellant and in favour of the Respondent. Hence this appeal is devoid of any merit and it is accordingly dismissed.  In consequence, the judgment of the High Court of justice, Borno State delivered on the 26th day of May, 2016 coram Hon. Justice A. Z. Musa is hereby affirmed.  Parties to bear their respective costs.   ADZIRA GANA MSHELIA, J.C.A.:  I have had the advantage of reading in draft the Judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Oniyangi, J.C.A, I agree that this appeal lacks merit and should be dismissed. I accordingly dismiss it. I endorse all the consequential orders made therein, including order as to costs.   BOLOUKUROMO MOSES UGO, J.C.A.:  I am of the same opinion with my learned brother MUDASHIRU NASIRU ONIYANGI, J.C.A. I also dismiss the appeal for lacking in merit.  Parties shall bear their costs.-end!" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The Respondent who was the plaintiff before the trial Court claimed to have purchased plots of land in dispute at a place described as Alidawari village in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State in 2003 and 2004 at a cost of N20,000.00 and N40,000.00 respectively from Alhaji Audu. He also claimed to have farmed on the land for 5 years. Then Respondent put a third party named Lawan Musa on the land to farm on it for about two years after which the land was handed back to the Respondent. When militant insurgency broke out in Borno State, claimant left the farm land with intent to resume farming when relative peace returned. However, when he came back to clear the said land for farming, he noticed the appellant trespassing into the land by demarcating it into various plots. When challenged, the appellant refused to yield and leave the land.  On his part the Defendant/Appellant asserted that he inherited the farm land from his father. However, his father never told him that he purchased any land, but it was one Bazanna, who showed the land to him in 1993 or 1994 after the demise of his father.  The Respondent thereupon approached the trial court with the following claims:  “a. A declaration that he is the lawful owner of the parcel of land situate at Alidawari village. b. An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendant by himself or his privy or agent and servant from any act of trespassing in or above the aforesaid land. c. Cost of the suit.\" -" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  PAUL ADAMU GALUMJE, J.S.C. Delivering the Leading Judgment: The appellant herein is a company incorporated in Nigeria with limited liability, and carries on the business of Design Engineering and construction in the Hydrocarbon Oil and Gas Sector in Nigeria.  The respondent is a company incorporated in Nigeria with limited liability and carries on the business of Natural Hydrocarbon Gas exploitation, transmission, management, distribution and sales.  Sometimes in March 1999, the appellant and the respondent entered into a written contract No. L01408 for the design and construction of subsurface and Submarine Natural Gas Pipeline for transmission and distribution of Natural Gas to Agbara and Ota, which contract had an effective date of commencement of 15th March, 2000 and a scheduled completion date of 20th October, 2000. The original contract ceiling stipulated in the contract was N393,563,264.00 and US$8,803,388.80.  During the execution of the contract, the appellant claimed that he incurred additional expenditures with the knowledge of the respondent. Even though the respondent made substantial payment to the appellant, misunderstanding ensued between them which led to the issuing of a letter of termination of the contract on the 4th of December, 2001 by the respondent. The appellant felt aggrieved by the termination of the contract by the respondent and therefore took out a writ of summons and a statement of claim both dated and filed on the 13th November, 2002, at the Federal High Court, Lagos Division, in which it claimed the following special damages:- 1. Value of the work done VOWD not paid for on the original contract N60,416,722.19 and USD1,351,426.88. 2. Completed Additional Works as agreed upon on joint site verification N85,505,938.11 and USD2,192,454.30 3. Interest on Returned invoices of August 2001 = N783,950,601.07. 4. Standby charges on personnel and equivalent as per contract =N325,756,723.60 and USD20,310,262.28. 5. Value of work done on extra dredging based on the Probing Result and Bathymetric Survey on the Oko-Omi River = N1,458,300.25 and USD10,121,436.00. 6. Interest on 1, 4, and above at 40% per annum from 612002, till 30102002 and thereafter of 22% per annum until judgment. 7. Interest on the judgment debt of 10% until satisfaction thereof.  In addition, the appellant claimed the sum of N2 billion in general damages for loss of good will, business prospects, sub-contractors, and staff loyalty, bankers confidences for failure to keep to scheduled loan repayment obligations, equipment deterioration etc.  The respondent as defendant at the trial Court filed a memorandum of conditional appearance on 20th November, 2002 and subsequently filed a statement of defence with annexures on the 12th December, 2002. This statement of defence was amended several times, and the final amended statement of defence was filed on the 19th November, 2007, wherein the respondent set out counter-claims.  Issues having been properly joined, the case proceeded to trial. At the end of the trial and in a reserved and considered judgment delivered on the 27th October, 2008, Okeke J., granted all the reliefs sought by the appellant and dismissed respondents counter claims.  Aggrieved with the decision, the respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal the lower Court Lagos Division and submitted nine issues distilled from nineteen grounds of appeal for determination of the appeal. For the first time, learned senior counsel for the respondent raised the issue of the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court, which was the fulcrum of the first issue for determination.  After extensive analysis of Section 2511n of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and reference to same cases decided by this Court, the lower Court came to conclusion that the trial Federal High Court lacked jurisdiction to hear, and determine the appellants claims which were based on simple contract. The respondents appeal was allowed and by virtue of Section 242 of the Federal High Court Act and by the authority of Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act, the lower Court transferred the ease to the Lagos State High Court that has the requisite jurisdiction, to hear and determine it.  The appellant before this Court is dissatisfied with the decision of the lower Court. Being aggrieved, it has brought this appeal. Its notice of appeal filed on the 3rd of June 2010 contains two grounds of appeal. These two grounds, without their particulars, are reproduced hereunder for clarity as follows:- 1. The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in law when they held, thus: The plaintiffrespondents action was for the recovery of monies for works allegedly done by the plaintiff respondent under the contract, which works plaintiff respondent claimed were not paid for by the defendant appellant. By the nature of the claim, I am of the firm view that Section 2511of the 1999 Constitution cannot be invoked to confer jurisdiction on the Federal High Court. The present case is simply an action for damages for alleged breach of contract. It is settled law that Federal High Court has no jurisdiction in mattersnof simple contract. 2. The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in law when they held that the issue placed before the trial Court and before this Court have nothing to do with \"mining operation and do not fall within the preview of Section 2511n of 1999 Constitution unlike SPDC v. Isaiah supra.  The respondent herein is also not happy with certain aspect of the judgment, particularly, the order of transfer of the case to the Lagos State High Court by the lower Court. Being aggrieved, it has appealed to this Court.  The appeal is given number SC.333A2010. The respondents notice of appeal filed on the 7th of June, 2010 contains three grounds of appeal, which I reproduced hereunder, without their particulars as follows:- 1. The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in law in ordering that the matter be transferred to the Lagos State High Court for determination instead of dismissing or striking out the plaintiffs entire claims. 2. The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in law when they failed to determine and pronounce on all the other issues for determination in the appeal simply because they had found that the lower Court wrongly assumed jurisdiction in the matter. 3. The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in law when they, suo motu, raised and determined the issue of transfer of the matter to the Lagos State High Court without affording the defendantappellant on opportunity of being heard on that point.  Parties filed and exchanged briefs of argument. There are two appeals before this Court arising from the same judgment. I will therefore determine the appeal filed by the appellant, before I deal with the appeal No. SC.333A2010, filed by the respondent.  The appellants brief of argument in SC.3332010 is settled by J.T.O. Ugboduma, Esq., Learned counsel formulated two issues for determination of this appeal. They read as follows:- 1Whether in view of the jurisdiction conferred on the Federal High Court Act, Cap. F12, LFN, 2004, the Court of Appeal was right when it held that the Federal High Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the appellants claim which arose from the construction of gas pipelines. 2 Whether the Court of Appeal was right when it held that the case of SPDC Ltd. v. Isaiah 2001 11 NWLRPt.723 168 does not apply to the facts of this case now on appeal.  Chief Richard Akinjide, learned senior counsel for respondent, settled the respondents brief of argument filed on the 8th of November, 2010. Learned senior counsel formulated one issue for determination of this appeal, in the following terms:- Having regard to the nature of the plaintiffs claims set out in the plaintiffs writ of summons and statement of claim, was the Court of Appeal right in holding that the plaintiffs suit is an action for damages for alleged breach of contract for which the Federal High Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain.  Learned counsel for appellant filed a reply brief on the 6th of December, 2010. I have carefully read through the record of this appeal and the briefs of argument filed by parties in this appeal. I am therefore of the firm view that the sole issue formulated by learned senior counsel to the respondent as adequately covered the field. I will therefore adopt the issue formulated by the respondent in the determination of this appeal.  In his argument, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the Court of Appeal was wrong in law to have held that the Federal High Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the appellants claim which arose from the construction of gas pipelines in view of the ample jurisdiction vested in the Federal High Court under Section 2511n of the 1999 Constitution and Sections 71n and 73 of the Federal High Court Act, 2004. In a further argument, learned counsel submitted that the Courts have consistently held that once the cause of action arose from or related to or is connected with or pertain to mines and minerals, including oil fields, oil mining, geological surveys and natural gas, it is the Federal High Court that has the exclusive jurisdiction to determine it. In aid, learned counsel cited Barry v. Eric 1998 8 NWLR Pt. 562 404 CA; The Shell Petroleum Dev. Co. of Nigeria Ltd v. Maxon 2001 9 NWLR Pt. 719 541 CA; The Shell Petroleum Dev. Co. of Nigeria v. Isaiah 2001 11 NWLR Pt. 723 168 SC; C.G.G. Nig. Ltd. v. Ogu 2005 8 NWLR Pt. 927 366.  For the respondent, it is argued that the Court of Appeal was right in holding that the appellants action at the trial Court is predicated on simple contract and that the Federal High Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the suit. Learned senior counsel cited several authorities in support of his submissions. I will consider some of these authorities in course of this judgment.  Generally it is the relief claimed that determines the jurisdiction of a Court. This is the position this Court has adopted in a myriad of cases, which include Adeyemi v. Opeyori 1976 9 - 10 SC 31; Tukur v. Government of Gongola State 1989 4 NWLR Pt. 117 517 at 549 paras B - D; Akinfolarin v. Akinnola 1994 3 NWLR Pt. 335 659; Magaji v. Matari 2000 8 NWLR Pt. 670 722 at 735 paras F- G. The question of whether a Court can entertain or exercise jurisdiction in a particular case or matter will, to a large extent, depend on the reliefs claimed, as endorsed in the writ of summons and the statement of claim. The reliefs claimed by the appellant in this case at the trial Court, has been reproduced elsewhere in this judgment.  The appellant admitted in its statement of claim that it entered into a contract of service with the respondent which is evidenced by a written contract No. L01408 and that because the respondent unilaterally revoked the contract aforesaid, that it resorted to Court action. It itemized its special claims into seven paragraphs. The first paragraph is claim for work done and not paid on the original contract ceiling. The second is for completed additional work as agreed on joint site verification. The fourth paragraph is claim for standby charges on personnel and equipment as per contract and forth. There is therefore nothing in the appellants claim that is connected to mines and minerals as provided for under Section 2511n of the 1999 Constitution.  Unlike the State High Court which is a Court of unlimited jurisdiction, the Federal High Court is a special Court with limited, but of exclusive jurisdiction clearly specified under Section 251 of the Constitution. It is plain that the Federal High Court will not assume jurisdiction on items outside Section 251 of the Constitution, unless jurisdiction on such matters is conferred upon it by the National Assembly. The lower Court found that the appellants claims at the trial Court were based on simple contract of service. I agree with the lower Courts finding, especially when the letter of termination of the contract dated 3rd December, 2001 is reckoned with. That letter of termination at page 272 volume 1 of the record of this appeal reads thus:- TERMINATION Of CONTRACT The above contract refers We hereby notify you of our intention to exercise our right of termination under the contract. Accordingly, this contract is hereby terminated pursuant to Article 21.1 of the contract with effect from 05.12.2001. We hereby propose a meeting at our officeat Freeman House, 2122 marina, Lagos on 06.12.2001 by 10.00 hours to agree on a schedule for a joint assessment of the work done including materials reconciliation and outstanding payments if any. We intend to close out this activity by 07122001.  From the claims of the appellant and the letter of termination as reproduced herein above, I have no doubt in my mind, that the lower Court was perfectly right when it held that the claims of the appellant were based on simple contract.  The nature and scope of activities to be undertaken in a contract document does not change the complexity of the contract. Even though the contract was for construction of Gas Distribution Pipelines, it does not translate into mines and minerals including oilfields, oil mining, geological surveys and natural gas as envisaged by Section 2511n of the Constitution. This Section in my view, concerns ownership and general administration of mines including mineral prospecting and incidental occurrences like damages from exposure to mineral resources. This is clearly not the issue in this case.  Learned counsel for the appellant has asked this Court to hold that this case is at all fours with the case of SPDC Ltd. v. Isaiah 2001 11 NWLR Pt. 723 168. This is not true. The decision in Isaiah concerned oil spillage into the claimants land. The plaintiffs case in Isaiah, is that, a tree fell on the defendants pipeline carrying crude oil from the production head to the flow station. The tree dented the pipeline. The defendant employed a contractor to repair the pipeline. In the course of the repairs and in attempt to replace the dented portion of the pipeline, noxious crude oil freely spilled and spread into the plaintiffs dry land, swamps and streams causing pollution. The plaintiffs sued for damages and maintained that the defendant did not construct an oil trap to contain the spillage and no other precautionary measures were taken by the defendant. The plaintiff also claimed that as a result of the spillage, all the uses to which they put the said land, swamps and streams were permanently terminated. Clearly, Isaiahs case cannot be at all fours with the instant case which deals solely with simple contract.  Having come to this conclusion, that the appellants claim is based on simple contract, was the lower Court right when it held that the Federal High Court has no jurisdiction. I answer this in the affirmative. In Adelekan v. ECU-Line NV 2006 12 NWLR Pt. 993 33 at 54 paras. F- H, this Court, per Onnoghen JSC, held:-  The provisions of Section 251 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, hereafter called the 1999 Constitution are very clear and unambiguous. It is the Section that confers jurisdiction on the Federal High Court, which jurisdiction clearly does not include dealing with any case of simple contract or damages for negligence as envisaged by the action before the trial court. See Onuorah v. KRPC 2005 6 NWLR Pt. 921 393.  I wish to emphasize that this case has nothing to do with mines and minerals and the authority of SPDC v. Isaiah supra is inapplicable. The sole issue which I adopted for the consideration of this appeal is resolved against the appellant. Having so resolved the issue against the appellant, this appeal shall be and it is hereby dismissed.  On the appeal No. SC.333A2010, the appellants brief of argument filed on the 20th September, 2010 was settled by Chief Richard Akinjide, SAN. At page 8 of the said brief of argument, learned senior counsel formulated three issues for determination of this appeal as follows:- 1. The Federal High Court having not declined jurisdiction in the matter but instead assumed jurisdiction, albeit wrongly, and determined on the merit the plaintiffrespondents claims and delivered a final judgment, whether or not the Court of Appeal was right in the circumstances of the matter, in invoking of Section 222 of the Federal High Court Act and transferring the matter to the Lagos State High Court for determination purportedly pursuant to Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act instead of striking out the plaintiff respondents claims. 2. Did the finding by the Court of Appeal on issue one of the defendantappellants brief of arguments that the Federal High Court wrongly assumed jurisdiction in the matter relieve the Court of Appeal, an intermediate Court of the duty to consider and determine the other eight issues for determination canvassed by the parties in the circumstances of this case? 3. Was the Court of Appeal right to have raised, considered and ordered, suo motu, that the matter be transferred to the High Court of Lagos State for determination without affording the parties an opportunity of being heard on that point before that decision was made.  Mr. J.T.O. Ugboduma, learned counsel for the respondent simply adopted the three issues formulated by learned senior counsel for the appellant.  In arguing the first issue for determination of this appeal, learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that Section 222of the Federal High Court Act and Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act are neither applicable nor available to the Court of Appeal in the circumstances of this case and were wrongly invoked by the Court of Appeal. In a further argument, learned senior counsel submitted that the Federal High Court did not decline jurisdiction but heard and determined all the issues both of law, and of facts in the matter on the merit and delivered final judgment. It is learned senior counsels contention that the Court of Appeal would have been right if the Federal High Court had declined jurisdiction but failed to transfer the matter to an appropriate High Court. In aid, learned senior counsel cited the authorities in Egbuziem v. Nigeria Railway Corporation 1994 3 NWLR Pt. 330 23 at 33, a decision of the Court of Appeal and Omoijahe v. Umoru 1999 8 NWLR Pt. 614 1. Also cited as examples of where matters were transferred by the Court of Appeal and this Court when those matters were yet to be determined on the merit are F.C.E., Oyo State v. Akinyemi 2008 15 NWLR Pt. 1109 21, and Gafar v. Govt. of Kwara State 2007 4 NWLR Pt. 1024 375; Ayman Enterprises Ltd. v. Akuma Industries Ltd 2003 12 NWLR Pt. 836 22. Learned senior counsel urged this Court to hold that any second trial by the High Court of Lagos State will grossly prejudice the appellant. Finally learned counsel urged the Court to resolve this issue in favour of the appellant.  In reaction to the argument proffered on behalf of the appellant, Mr. J.T.O. Ugboduma, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the cross-appeal against the order of transfer of the suit from the Federal High Court to the Lagos State High Court pursuant to Section 22 of the Federal High Court Act made by the Court of Appeal under Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act is incompetent, by virtue of Section 22 of the Federal High Court Act which makes the order unappealable.  In a further argument, learned counsel submitted that apart from the incompetence of the appeal, the Court of Appeal properly invoked the provisions of Section 222 of the Federal High Court Act and Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act to transfer the case without hearing the parties. Learned counsel cited a host of authorities in support of his submission and finally urged this Court to resolve the first issue for determination of this appeal in favour of the respondent.  As a preliminary point, I wish to state that a right to appeal is a very important constitutional right and its exercise cannot be curtailed or fettered by any legislation. Section 11 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 provides that the Constitution is supreme and its provisions shall have binding force on all authorities and person throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Subsection 3 of the same Section says, if any other law is inconsistent with the provisions of this Constitution, this Constitution shall prevail, and that other law shall to the extent of the inconsistency be void. Section 224 of the Federal High Court Act which makes any order of transfer of a matter unappealable is inconsistent with the provision of Section 233 of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria. In Aqua Ltd. v. Ondo State Sports Council 1988 LPELR 527 SC, this Court per Karibi- Whyte said:- It is an elementary and fundamental proposition that a right conferred by the Constitution cannot be taken away by any other provision except by the Constitution itself. The Constitution having conferred a right of appeal as of right, the Court of Appeal Act or rules of practice made under the Act, which derive their force from the Constitution cannot take away such a right. Any law so made will be inconsistent with the constitutional provision and void. In Obikoya v. Wema Bank Ltd. 1998 LPELR- 2176 SC, this Court per Oputa, J.S.C. said:- A right to appeal is a very important constitutional right and its exercise ought not to be unduly fettered. In Skye Bank v. Iwu, Ogunbiyi, J.S.C. made it clear, when he said:- Constitutional right of an appeal whether as of right or with leave of a litigant cannot be curtailed or circumscribed except by an express provision in the Constitution. There should therefore be no reason to encourage the removal of such as it will signal dangerous trend. See PDP v. Sherrif 2017 LPELR- 42736 SC; Bello v. AG., Oyo State 1986 5 NWLR 828; Total International Ltd. v. Awogboro 1994 4 NWLR Pt. 337 147.  From the decision of this Court which I have cited above, it is very clear that Section 224 of the Federal High Court Act, barring a party from exercising his constitutional right is void. The appellants appeal herein is competent.  The starting point in this appeal is to examine the provisions of Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act, which deals with the general powers of the Court of Appeal. The Section reads as follows:- The Court of Appeal may, from time to time, make any order necessary for determining the real question in controversy in the appeal, and may amend any defect or error in the record of appeal, and may direct the Court below to inquire into and certify its findings on any question which the Court of Appeal thinks fit to determine before final judgment in the appeal, and may make an interim order or grant an injunction which the Court below is authorized to make or grant and may direct any necessary inquiries or accounts to be made or taken, and, generally shall have full jurisdiction over the whole proceedings as if the proceedings had been instituted in the Court of Appeal, as Court of first instance and may re-hear the case in whole or in part or may remit it to the Court below for the purpose of such re-hearing or may give such other directions as to the manner in which the Court below shall deal with the case in accordance with the powers of that Court, or, in the case of an appeal from the Court below, in that Courts appellate jurisdiction, order the case to be re-heard by a Court of competent jurisdiction. Italics is mine.  The provision of Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act is very clear as to the use of the powers of that Court. The power of the Court is to make order, necessary for determining the real issue in controversy in the appeal. The power clearly is not to strike out or dismiss an appeal in which the issues in controversy have not been fully determined. The Section also stipulates that the Court shall have full jurisdiction over the whole proceedings as if the proceedings had been instituted in the Court of Appeal as a Court of first instance.  This provision clearly means that whatever the Federal High Court was competent to do, the Court of Appeal is as well competent to do the same thing. Now this brings me to the question as to whether the Federal High Court had the competence to transfer the present case to the Lagos State High Court. Section 222 of the Federal High Act provides as follows:- No cause or matter shall be struck out, the Court merely on the ground that such cause was taken in the Court instead of the High Court of a State or of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja in which it ought to have been brought, and the Judge of the Court before whom such cause or matter is brought, may cause such cause or matter to be transferred to the appropriate High Court of a State or of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja in accordance with Rules of Court to be made under Section 44 of this Act.  The Federal High Court in pursuant to the provision of Section 44 of the Federal High Court Act, promulgated the Federal High Court Civil Procedure Rules, 2009. Order 49 Rule 5 of the said Rules provides as follows:- Where a Judge has in the exercise of the powers conferred by Section 222 of the Act directed that any cause or matter be transferred to the High Court of a State or the Federal Capital Territory, the Judge shall make an order under his hand to that effect to the Chief Judge of the High Court of the State or the Federal Capital Territory to which the matter is to be transferred.  There is nothing in any of the provisions of the Act and the Rules of the Federal High Court which I have referred to in this judgment that says a Judge must decline jurisdiction before the order of transfer is made. I have also not come across any provision that says where a Judge wrongly assumes jurisdiction and determines a case to finality, an order of transfer under Section 222 of the Federal High Court cannot be made. The decision whether to transfer a case or not will depend entirely on the nature of the proceedings in the case. Once it is held that the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a matter ab initio, its decision is a nullity. In the instant case, since the Federal High Court has no jurisdiction to hear the claim of the respondent ab initio, its decision is a nullity. See Ayman Ent. Ltd. v. Akuma Industries Ltd. 2003 12 NWLR Pt. 836 22 at 50 paras. E - F. Once a decision is a nullity, it is taken that the Court never assumed jurisdiction at all. The argument that the Court assumed jurisdiction, albeit wrongly cannot be factored into the case as to deprive an appellate Court from giving appropriate directive or order. Section 222 of the Federal High Court Act is made by the National Assembly for due preservation of cases that have been instituted in wrong Courts. It is not contrary to any of the provisions of the Constitution and this Court has in a number of cases upheld its validity. InGafar v. The Government of Kwara State 2007 4 NWLR Pt. 1024 375, the appellant instituted an action at the Federal High Court in Ilorin, in which he sought to enforce his fundamental right. Appellant was in the service of the Government of Kwara State as Secretary to the Government. A commission of inquiry in its report had indicted the appellant and he was asked to pay the sum of N2 million to the Kwara State Government or forfeit his assets. The respondents on being served, filed a preliminary objection challenging the jurisdiction of the trial Federal High Court to entertain the action of the appellant having regard to the circumstances of the case and the reliefs claimed therein. After hearing both parties, the trial Court dismissed the respondents preliminary objection and held that it had jurisdiction to entertain the action.  Dissatisfied with the decision, the respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal after considering the issue of jurisdiction alone, and transferred the case to the Kwara State High Court.  The appellant was dissatisfied with the decision of the Court of Appeal and he appealed to the Supreme Court. In a lead judgment delivered by Mahmud Mohammed, JSC as he then was at page 399 paras. D- E, held: I entirely agree with the Court below that the trial Federal High Court lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the appellants action as brought before the Court. This being the position, the Court below is also right in sending the case to the High Court of Kwara State which has the necessary jurisdiction to hear and determine all the claims of the appellant. Similarly, in Oliver v. Dangote Ind. Ltd. 2009 10 NWLR Pt. 1150 467 at 490- 491 paras H- C. The Court of Appeal per Salami, JCA as he then was held:-  The trial Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the suit which is substantially a claim in contract. The trial Court, Federal High Court, could properly transfer the matter to the Court competent to hear and determine the action under Section 222 of the Federal High Court Act, Cap. F12 of the Laws of Federation of Nigeria, 2004 This Court, like any other appellate Court, is vested with power of the trial Court. By virtue of Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act, the matter is transferred to the Lagos State High Court for determination.  In the two cases, I have cited hereinabove, the Federal High Court did not decline jurisdiction. Rather, the Federal High Court assumed jurisdiction to determine whether it had jurisdiction but did not hear the matters to finality. Even if the matter were heard to finality, it would have made no difference, since any Court proceeding that is conducted without jurisdiction is a nullity. See also Mokelu v. Federal Commissioner for Works and Housing 1976 1 NWLR 329 at 332- 333.  Most of the issues raised and canvassed in the reply brief of the appellant are issues that have been argued in its brief of argument. This is clearly not the essence of reply brief. Where a Court lacks jurisdiction or where the grounds of appeal are incompetent, they remain so. It does not matter whether such defect in jurisdiction and grounds of appeal are raised by way of preliminary objection or argued in the issues for determination of the appeal, they cannot be discountenanced by the Court seized with the matter if those defects have the effect of ousting the Courts jurisdiction. So there is nothing wrong in the respondents objection to the 1st and 3rd grounds of appeal contained in the notice of appeal.  The first issue for determination of this appeal is resolved against the appellant.  On the 2nd issue for determination of this appeal, learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the Court of Appeal as an intermediate appellate Court, was wrong in failing to consider and determine the other eight issues for determination fully argued by the parties before the Court of Appeal after it decided that the trial Federal High Court has no jurisdiction to hear the suit. Yes, this Court has held in a number of decided cases that an intermediate Court, such as the Court of Appeal, has a duty to consider all the issues that are properly raised before it. The reason why this Court has asked intermediate Court to consider all the issues raised before it, is that in event of such intermediate Courts decision on the point or points considered by it being reversed on further appeal to this Court, its decision on the rest of the other points may then be considered for a final determination of the appeal. See Owners of the MV Arabell v. N.A.I.C. 2008 11 NWLR Pt. 1097 182; Ifeanyi Chukwu Osondu Ltd. v. Saleh Boneh Ltd. 2000 5 NWLR Pt. 656 322 at 351 paras. F - H; Owodunni v. Registered Trustees of CCC 2000 10 NWLR Pt. 675 315. Even though this Court frowns at the procedure of considering one issue out of many by intermediate Court, it has never pronounced such decisions invalid.  Where an intermediate appellate Court correctly decides a matter upon consideration of one issue out of many, this Court will have no reason to interfere with such decision. This is so because the reason for asking an intermediate appellate Court to consider all the issues raised is in event where the decision on the issue is reversed on further appeal, there will be nothing left to fall on. In the instant case, the lower Court rightly decided that the Federal High Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter before it. Having correctly determined the issue dealing with the jurisdiction of the trial Court, it had no obligation to consider the remaining eight issues. See Etajata v. Ologbo 2007 16 NWLR Pt. 1061 554 at 579 - 582 paras. A - D.  Learned senior counsels argument in respect of this issue is clearly without base. This issue is also resolved against the appellant.  On issue three, learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the lower Court is wrong when it raised suo motu the issue of transfer of the case under Section 222 of the Federal High Court Act in its judgment without affording the parties the opportunity of being heard on that point. In aid, learned counsel cited Ebba v. Ogodo 1984 15 NSCC 255 at 265; Iriri v. Erhurhobara 1991 2 NWLR Pt. 173 252 at 265.  Learned senior counsel in a further argument, submitted that the failure of the lower Court to invite parties to address the Court on the issue of transfer of the case is against the principle of fair hearing and cannot be sustained.  In aid, learned senior counsel cited Humbe v. Hueze 2001 4 NWLR Pt. 703 372. I think, learned senior counsel has got it wrong when he argues that the failure of the lower Court to call for further address, before the order for transfer of the case to the Lagos State High Court. The appellants complaint before the lower Court was that the Federal High Court has no jurisdiction to hear the matter before it. The lower Court in its judgment did answer the question affirmatively when it delivered its judgment. What followed thereafter is a consequential order which is the prerogative of the Court. A consequential order is an order that follows as a result of the earlier order. It may have an indirect or secondary result in the relief awarding process. See Eagle Super Pack Nig. Ltd. v. ACB Plc 2006 19 NWLR Pt. 1013 20. A consequential order merely gives effect to a judgment or order to which it is consequential. It is directly traceable to or flow from the judgment or order duly prayed for and made. See Obayagbona v. Obazee 1972 5 SC 247.  Parties were heard before the judgment of the Court from which the order of transfer was made. There is therefore no breach of fair hearing by the lower Court as the learned senior counsel would want this Court to decide. Section 222 of the Federal High Court Act says: No cause or matter shall be struck out by the Court... Clearly this is a mandatory provision, which left no room for the lower Court to manoeuvre when it acted under Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act.  This issue is similarly resolved against the appellant.  Having resolved the three issues submitted for determination of this appeal, against the appellant, this appeal shall be and it is hereby dismissed.  On the whole, the two appeals numbers SC.3332010 and SC.333A2010 are both dismissed. Parties shall bear their respective costs.   IBRAHIM TANKO MUHAMMAD, AG. C.J.N.:  I have had the opportunity of reading in draft a copy of the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Galumje, J.S.C. I am in complete agreement with my Lords reasoning and conclusion contained in the lead judgment that the appeal lacks merit and it should be dismissed. I too hereby dismiss the appeal. I abide by all orders made in the lead judgment.   OLUKAYODE ARIWOOLA, J.S.C.:  I had the opportunity of reading in draft the lead judgment of my learned brother, Galumje, J.S.C. just delivered. I agree entirely with the reasoning and conclusion that the appeal is unmeritorious and should be dismissed. I too will dismiss the appeal.   JOHN INYANG OKORO, J.S.C.:  The facts and circumstances leading to the two appeals numbered SC.3332010 and SC.333A2010 have been summarized in great details by my learned brother, Paul Adamu Galumje, JSC in the Judgment which I had a preview before now and with which I am in complete agreement. I have found no reasons to differ in the reasoning leading to my brother's conclusions in both appeals. In appreciation of the lead judgment, I will proffer a few comments of my own, which shall be based majorly on the sole issue adumbrated in the main appeal, to wit: \"Having Regard to the nature of the plaintiff's claims set out in plaintiff's writ of summons and statement of claim, was the Court of Appeal right in holding that the plaintiffs suit is an action for damages for alleged breach of contract for which the Federal High Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain.\"  My response to the question posed above is in the affirmative. This Court has held in a plethora of cases that disputes founded on contracts are not among those envisaged in the exclusive jurisdiction conferred on the Federal High Court under Section 251 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended. See Onuorah v. Kaduna Refining & Petrochemical Co. Ltd 2005 6 NWLR pt. 921 393, Adelekan v. ECU-line NV 2006 12 NWLR pt. 993 33 at 54.  A careful perusal of the written Contract No. L01408 between the parties in this appeal would reveal that they entered into a simple contract for the design and construction of subsurface and submarine Natural Gas pipeline for transmission of natural gas to Agbara and Ota.  I hold the view that an agreement between two private persons to construct \"gas pipeline', as in this case, does not fall within the contemplation of the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court under Section 2511n of the 1999 Constitution. Clearly, the Appellant cannot confer jurisdiction on a Court where the Constitution says that the Court does not have jurisdiction.  I agree that in determining conditions precedent to the invocation of the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court under Section 251 of the 1999 Constitution, the observation of my brother, Rhode-Vivour, J.S.C. in the case of PDP v Sylva 2012 13 NWLR pt. 1316 85 at 138 B- E is apt. See also Enterprise Bank Ltd v Ltd v Aroso 2015 3 NWLR pt.1394 386 at 291. In the above cases, my Lord reiterated his observation as follows: \"Section 251 of the Constitution confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal High Court for the items listed in the section. All items not listed in the section are to be heard and determined by the State High Court. When the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court is in issue, the following must co- exist: a the parties or party must be the Federal Government or its agency. b Subject matter of the litigation. Satisfying the above is not the end of the matter. The pleadings of the plaintiff must be carefully examined so as to understand the facts and circumstances of the case in order to determine if the claims are within the jurisdiction of the Court.\"  The above represents the position of this Court and we have not departed from it. Applying the above to the instant case therefore, it is obvious that the claims of the Appellant emanates from a simple contract which was terminated by the Respondent. The claims of the Appellant are therefore clearly outside the contemplation of Section 2511n of the 1999 Constitution and conditions set down in the above decided cases.  In the final analysis, I entirely agree with my learned brother that both the main appeal and the cross-appeal are lacking in merit and are accordingly dismissed by me. I affirm the judgment of the Court below.  Appeal Dismissed.   UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI, J.S.C.:  I was privilege to read in draft the lead judgment of my learned brother, P.A. Galumje, J.S.C. and I agree with his reasoning and conclusion arrived thereat.  Appeals SC.3332010 and SC.333A2010 were merged for consideration by my learned brother, Galumje JSC, since their parties and facts are akin.  In the 2 appeals, the issue of the jurisdiction of the trial Court to entertain a case of simple contract featured and whether the issue of the trial Court's power to transfer a case to the appropriate Court with jurisdiction without calling on parties amounted to breach of fair hearing respectively.  The parties sometime in 1999 entered into a written contract for the design and construction of subsurface and submarine natural gas pipeline for transmission and distribution of natural gas to Agbara and Ota to commence on 1532000 and complete on 20102000 at the cost price of N393,563,264.00US$8,803,389.80. Eventually, due to some misunderstanding, the contract was terminated by the Respondent which caused the institution of the case before the Federal High Court, Lagos.  The fact that the issue of design and construction of subsurface and submarine natural gas pipeline for transmission and distribution of natural gas to Agbara and Ota is involved does not make the contract or bring it under Section 251 of the Constitution. By the Appellant's letter of termination of contract dated 3122001, it clearly reveals that it was a case of simple contact. Besides, what determines the jurisdiction of a Court is the plaintiff's claim and not otherwise or as may be provided by law. See FELIX ONUORAH v. KADUNA REFINING AND PETROCHEMICAL CO. LTD 2005 6 NWLR PT. 921 393. In the instant appeal, the claims of the Respondent have demonstrated this that what they seek after is a remedy for a breach of contract of service and nothing else.  A similar case came up before this Court inTSKJ NIG LTD v. OTOCHEM NIG LTD 2018 LPELR- 44294 SC, wherein Per MUHAMMAD, JSC rightly observed that the transaction between the parties is that of houseboat hire. This, in my view, is a simple contract and not an admiralty or maritime matter. By the constitutional provisions of a State High Court, it is the Port Harcourt High Court and not the Federal High Court that has jurisdiction over this simple contractual engagement. This is because, a careful observation and literal construction of the averments of the statement of claim is to the effect that the action filed before the trial Court is for the recovery of accrued and unpaid hire rentals for a houseboat let to the Appellant by the Respondent and damages for breach of the contract. The mere fact that a ship is involved in a simple contract does not automatically make that simple contract a subject for jurisdiction in admiralty matters. To hold to that supposition will be ridiculous. This case of a simple contract of debt recovery is, I hold, within the civil jurisdiction of the Rivers State High Court and it properly assumed jurisdiction on the matter.  Per KUMAI BAYANG AKAAHS, JSC, in the same case revealed that from the Amended statement of claim reproduced above that the main plank of the plaintiffs case is the breach of the terms of payment by the defendant in respect of the contract entered into between the plaintiff and defendant. The action instituted by the plaintiff before the Rivers state High Court is for the recovery of accrued but unpaid hire rentals for the houseboat let by the plaintiff to the defendant and damages for breach of the contract simpliciter. The present case is clearly a claim for recovery of accrued hire rentals for the houseboat and damages for breach of contract even though the houseboat had to be conveyed from Warri to Bonny by sea. The definition of the houseboat being \"a flat bottomed boat or barge with a superstructure fitted out for living in\" cannot affect the jurisdiction of the Rivers state High Court from adjudicating on the breach of the contract.  On the issue of the trial Court's power to transfer a case to the appropriate Court with jurisdiction without calling on parties to address it, I will not hesitate to state that it does not amount to breach of fair hearing as rightly held by my learned brother Galumje, JSC, in the lead judgment. Per OGBUAGU, JSC in FASAKIN FOODS NIG. LTD. v. SHOSANYA 2006 LPELR-1244 SC reiterated that the Federal High Court can transfer a cause or matter to a State High Court, by virtue of Section 222 of the Act. See also ALUMINIUM MANUFACTURING CO. NIG. LTD. v. N.P.A. 1987 1.  Section 222 of the Federal High Court Act is a saving provision. It saves a matter duly and properly filed in a Court of law from being struck out. Instead of striking out for lack of jurisdiction, Section 222 vests in the Federal High Court, the power to transfer the matter to the appropriate Court. See Per NIKI TOBI, JSC in FASAKIN FOODS NIG. LTD. v. SHOSANYA 2006 LPELR- 1244 SC. Thus, the power exercised by the trial Court is within the ambit of the law to do so. In fact, may I produce the relevant Section for emphasis. Section 2212 of the Federal High Court Act provides:- \"22. 1 A Judge of the Court at any time or at any stage of the proceedings in any cause or matter before final judgment, either with or without application from any of the parties thereto, shall transfer such cause or matter before him to other Judge of the Court. 1975 No. 36. 2 No cause or matter shall be struck out by the Court merely on the ground that such cause or was taken in the Court instead of the High Court of a State or of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja in which it ought to have been brought, and the Judge of the Court before whom such cause or matter is brought may cause such cause or matter to be transferred to the appropriate High Court of a State or of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja in accordance with Rules of Court to be made under Section 44 of this Act.\"  The Federal High Court Judge therefore has power to order a transfer suo motu. In the exercise of the powers above, the Judge is merely acting administratively and the issue of lack of fair hearing cannot avail a party raising it in the circumstances. Clearly there is no right of appeal where the Judge, in his administrative capacity, transfers a case from one Court to another either suo motu or upon the application of a party to the suit.  I therefore agree with the decision and reasons reached by my learned brother, Galumje, J.S.C., in dismissing the 2 appeals.-end!   " ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  Both parties are companies incorporated in Nigeria which primary operations fall under the legislative domains of the National Assembly to wit: business of Design Engineering/construction in the Hydrocarbon Oil/Gas Sector in Nigeria and Natural Hydrocarbon Gas exploitation, transmission, management, distribution and sales respectively. Their operations, therefore, prima facie seems to fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court. However, the dispute disclosed in the Appellant/Plaintiff writ was that of a simple contract for the design and construction of subsurface and Submarine Natural Gas Pipeline for transmission and distribution of Natural Gas to Agbara and Ota, which contract had an effective date of commencement of 15th March, 2000 and a scheduled completion date of 20th October, 2000. During the execution of the contract, the appellant claimed that he incurred additional expenditures with the knowledge of the respondent. Even though the respondent made substantial payment to the appellant, misunderstanding ensued between them which led to the issuing of a letter of termination of the contract on the 4th of December, 2001 by the respondent.  The appellant, aggrieved by the termination of the contract took out a writ of summons and a statement of claim at the Federal High Court, Lagos Division, in which it claimed special damages, N2 billion in general damages for loss of goodwill, business prospects, sub-contractors, and staff loyalty, bankers confidences for failure to keep to scheduled loan repayment obligations, equipment deterioration etc., among other reliefs.  The trial court (Federal High Court, Lagos, Okeke J.), granted all the reliefs sought by the appellant and dismissed respondents counter claims. Court of Appeal (Lagos Division) heard the appeal of the Respondents during which, for the first time, Respondents raised the issue of the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court. After extensive analysis of Section 251(1)(n) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and references to decided cases, the lower Court came to conclusion that the trial Federal High Court lacked jurisdiction to hear, and determine the appellants claims which were based on simple contract. The respondents’ appeal was allowed and by virtue of Section 24(2) of the Federal High Court Act and further, by the authority of Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act, the lower Court transferred the ease to the Lagos State High Court as a judicial forum with the requisite jurisdiction, to hear and determine the case.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  ABDULLAHI MAHMUD BAYERO, J.C.A. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  This Appeal originated from the Adamawa State Upper Area Court No. 2 in case number UAC24CVF1232013 wherein the Respondent as Plaintiff before the trial Upper Area Court sued the 1st Appellant. On 6112013, the RespondentPlaintiff through his Counsel C. K. Atiman Esq., applied orally to join the 2nd Appellant. The application was granted. Two witnesses PW1 and PW2 testified for the RespondentPlaintiff. The AppellantDefendant did not present any witness. The trial Court entered judgment in favour of the Respondent. Dissatisfied, the Appellants appealed to the lower Court. The lower Court delivered its judgment on 19th December, 2016 in favour of the Respondent. Miffed with the judgment, the Appellants appealed to this Court by leave granted on 5th July, 2017. Notice of Appeal was filed on 12th July, 2017. The original Record of Appeal was compiled and transmitted on 8th September, 2017. It was re-compiled and transmitted on 4th October, 2019 but deemed properly transmitted on 14th October, 2019. The Appellants Brief was filed on 29th September, 2017 but deemed properly filed and served on 14th October, 2019. The Respondents Brief was filed on 23rd November, 2017 but deemed properly filed and served on 14th October, 2019.  In the Appellants Brief, three issues are distilled for determination thus: 1 Whether the Lower Court sitting on appeal was right when considering the provision of Section 12a of the Area Court Law of Adamawa State it held that the trial Upper Area Court had the jurisdiction to determine the Suit before it having regard to the status of the 2nd Appellant, a non natural person under the law? Distilled from Ground 1 of the Grounds of Appeal 2 Whether the lower Court sitting on appeal was right when it held that the subsequent proceedings of the trial Upper Area Court conducted without notice to the Appellants were not in breach of the Appellants right to fair hearing under Section 36 of the Constitution of Nigeria? Distilled from Ground 2 and 3 of the Grounds of Appeal. 3. Whether the lower Court was right when it dismissed the Appellants Issue four submitted before it while holding that the Respondent proved his case before the trial Area Court despite the material contradictions in the evidence of the two witnesses? Distilled from Ground 4 of the Grounds of Appeal.  On issue one, Counsel submitted that by the provisions Section 121 a b of the Area Court Law Cap 11 Laws of Adamawa State 1987, an Area Court can only exercise jurisdiction over a natural person. Thus, the trial Upper Area Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim of the Respondent before it as against the 2nd Appellant which is a Company incorporated under Nigerian laws and thus a non natural person. Section 121a b is reproduced as follows: 121 Subject to the provisions of this Edict and any other written Law, the following persons shall be subject to the jurisdiction of Area Courts: a any person whose parents were members of any tribe of tribes indigenous to some part of Africa and the descendants of any such person; b any person one whose parents was a member of such tribe; c any other person in a cause or matter in which he consents to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Area Court.  He placed reliance on Uwazurike & 6 Ors. v. AG Federation 2007 2 S.C. 169 at 179, Gafar v. Government of Kwara State 2007 1-2 S.C. 189 at 216-217; Mobil Producing Nig. Unlimited v. Monokpo 2004 9 WRN 84-85 and submitted that the jurisdiction of the Area Court is limited to natural persons.  That the lower Court was referred to and ignored completely the decision of the same lower Court in the case of Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. v. Dr. Musa Dahiru & 1 Or. Suit No. ADSY18M2010 unreported judgment of the High Court of Justice of Adamawa State delivered on the 21st of July, 2010, where the lower Court per Hon. Justice Hafsat Abdulrahman held that an Area Court has no jurisdiction over an incorporated company and the case of Fouad Shour v. Fauzija 1971 N.N.L.R Page 133. That the lower Court in its judgment did not even make any reference to the said decisions as to their applicability in the matter.  According to counsel, since the area Court lacks jurisdiction over a non natural person any exercise of such jurisdiction will be ultra vires, null and void and any proceedings thereto will amount to a nullity; relying on Madukolu v. Nkemdilim1962 2 SCNLR 341 348. That it is the claims of the parties that give the CourtTribunal jurisdiction.  He further submitted that since the 2nd Appellant is an artificial person, the lower Court lacks the jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter before it going by the provisions of the Area Court Law Section 121 and relying on Mobil Producing Nig. Unlimited v. Monokpo [2004] ALL FWLR Pt. 195 575 at 657 paragraph H.  According to counsel, the claim of the Respondent is principally against the 2nd Appellant which necessitated joining the 2nd Defendant on the application of the Respondent. That the suit was incompetent and all proceedings conducted thereto is a nullity.  He urged the Court to resolve issue one in favour of the Appellant.  On issue two, it was the submission of learned counsel that by the combined effect of Sections 361, 2 3 and 4 and 294 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended, a Court vested with judicial authority must deliver its judgment in the presence of the parties to the suit, in public and afford the parties the opportunity of appealing against the judgment.  According to counsel, on 4th November, 2014 the Respondents counsel applied for the Appellants to be foreclosed from making any defence as shown at page 20 of the Record. That the Upper Area Court adjourned the matter to 18112014 for judgment page 21 of the Record. That the Appellants were entitled to be served with hearing notice for the adjourned date of 18112014. More so that the Court failed to deliver the judgment on the 18112014 and chose the 23122014 when it delivered same.  That no hearing notice was served on the Appellants of the judgment of the 23122014 as reflected on pages 21-22 of the Record. This counsel submitted is a breach of the right of fair hearing of the Appellant. He referred to Achuzia v. Ogbomah 2016 Vol. 262 LRCN 91 at 103-105 where it was held that in the process of adjudication in a Court of law, service of processes and hearing notice on the defendant is sine qua non to the assumption of jurisdiction by a Court except in matters which the law permit to be heard ex-parte. Thus the Court must satisfy itself of proof of notice of hearing before it proceeds to hear the matter and give judgment on the evidence adduced before it. Where a Court fails to do so, and proceeds to hear the case, the proceeding, no matter how well conducted is a nullity. A Court of law must satisfy itself that all parties had notice of hearing of a matter before it assumes jurisdiction to hear and determine the case. Failure to do so renders the entire proceedings a nullity. That the Court further held that the service of hearing notice on the defendant is a Constitutional matter as provided under Section 361 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999.  On issue three, counsel submitted that the trial Court was wrong to have granted the claims of the RespondentPlaintiff when he has not proved same. That the law is settled that a Plaintiff must succeed on the strength of his own case not on the weakness of the defence. He cited the case of Nwavu v. Okoye 2009 ALL FWLRPart 451 page 815 at page 840 paragraphs E-G.  That there was material contradiction in the name of PW2 whether it was Engineer Robinson Isaac or Robinson Isiah. Yet the lower Court relied on the testimony from the witness to give judgment against the defendants. According to counsel, PW1 could not prove his claims before the lower Court because the witness under cross examination did not state the exact amount he claimed from the Appellant; nor was he able to state the extent of the work he did for the Appellant and the amount due. All these according to counsel go to show that the Respondent did not prove his case before the lower Court to be entitled to judgment. He placed reliance on the case of Victabio Ventures Ltd. v. W. Van Der Rwan Z.N.B.V 2009 ALL FWLR Part 490 page 56 at page 80 and urged this Court to resolve issue three in favour of the Appellant, allow the Appeal and set aside the judgment of the lower Court.  In his response, learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that they have formulated three issues for determination thus:- 1. WHETHER LOWER COURT WAS RIGHT TO HOLD THE TRIAL COURT HAD JURISDICTION OVER THE 2ND APPELLANT AND WHETHER THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT CAN STAND WITHOUT HIM. 2. WHETHER THE LOWER COURT WAS NOT RIGHT TO HOLD THAT THE APPELLANTS WERE ACCORDED FAIR HEARING AT THE TRIAL COURT. 3. WHETHER THE LOWER COURT WAS NOT RIGHT WHEN IT HELD THAT THE RESPONDENT WAS ABLE TO PROVE HIS CASE AT THE TRIAL COURT.  On issue one, it is submitted that there is no place in the entire Area Court Civil Procedure Rules or Area Court Edict that states that Area Court can only adjudicate on natural persons. That Section 121ab is meant to take care of a situation where the parties are natural persons in order to protect foreigners so that native laws are not applied against them unless they surrender themselves to the jurisdiction of the Court. That there is no ambiguity in the wordings of the section.  That the case of Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. v. Musa Dahiru & 1 Or. Supra which the Appellant refers to is a decision of Adamawa State High Court which is a Court of coordinate jurisdiction with the lower Court, as such that decision is of persuasive and not binding authority. That the Appellant's counsel is limiting his argument to Section 121ab of the Area Court Law ignoring sub Section c of the same law which provides: \"...and other person in a cause or matter in which he consents to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Area Court.\"  According to Counsel, since the 2nd Appellant participated in the proceedings at the lower Court with his Counsel, he is estopped from complaining now. He further referred to Sections 13 1 of the Area Court Rules Cap. 11 Laws of Adamawa State 1987 which provides:- \"where at any stage of the proceedings before final Judgment in any cause or matter whether Civil or Criminal in an Area Court a person alleges that he is not subject to the Jurisdiction of Area Court, such proceedings shall on the application of such person to the High Court be transferred to the High Court that shall inquire into and determine the truth of such person's allegation.\"  That Order 3 Rule 3 of the Area Court Civil Procedure Rules, 1971 which provides:- \"Service on a Local Authority shall be effected by the provision of Section 117 of Local Authority Law.\"  According to counsel, from the above provisions, the Area Court has jurisdiction to try the 2nd Appellant. Counsel further submitted that the Respondent before the trial Court on page 6 of the Record lines 9-10 told the Court that:- \"I informed the 1st Defendant of my intention to sue. That is why I am before the Court to seek my money from the 1st Defendant.\"  That the lower Court in its judgment contained on pages 19-25 especially paragraph 2 of the judgment held: Consequently, I hereby enter Judgment for the Plaintiff and further ordered as follows: 1. That the 1st Defendant who is the owner of the 2nd Defendant pay the Plaintiff the sum of N1,670,000.00 being outstanding balance due to the Plaintiff from the 1st Defendant for the hire of the Plaintiff constructions vehicle of a grader and an excavator. 2. The Defendants are to pay the Plaintiff 10% interest on the Judgment sum of N1, 670,000.00.  That from the above, it is clear that the Respondent asked for his balance from the 1st Defendant who is a natural person. That with or without the 2nd Defendant2nd Appellant being a party, the PlaintiffRespondents claim can still stand against the 1st Appellant. He urged the Court to resolve issue one in favour of the Respondent.  As to issue two, Counsel submitted that contrary to the submissions of the Appellants Counsel, there is nowhere in the 1999 Constitution that states that judgment of Court must be delivered in the presence of parties.  That Section 361 talks about fair hearing within a reasonable time, Section 361 talks about person whose right has been violated to be represented which of course the Appellants were represented, Section 363 talks of delivering Judgment in an open Court which the trial Court did and Section 364 talks of reasonable time in criminal cases, strange enough, this is a civil matter.  It is submitted that when the case came up on 15102014 both counsel were in Court and the matter was adjourned for the last time to 4112014. That still on the said date both the Defendant and his Counsel were absent. That judgment was not delivered on that day until 23122014. That the question to be answered is whether a judgment of a Court can be set aside because it was delivered without notice to the other party? He referred to the case of Cotecna International Ltd. v. Church gate Nig. Ltd. 2011 ALL FWLR Pt. 575 261 at 262 where the Supreme Court held that:- .. it would appear to me and I am of the view that the delivery of Judgment earlier than scheduled date without notice to the Appellant will not nullify the Judgment unless the Appellant show that it has resulted in miscarriage of justice, the Appellant has not shown that any miscarriage of justice has occasioned because its counsel was not present when the Judgment was read. It is not shown that if the Appellants counsel had listen to the Judgment which was in open Court, the decision could have been otherwise.   According to Counsel, it was not shown how the delivery of the judgment in Appellants Counsel absence occasioned any miscarriage of justice or that the judgment would have been in his favour for the simple fact that he was around.  On the complaint that the Appellants were foreclosed from their defence as shown at page 8 paragraph 4:04 of the Appellants Brief, it is submitted that after the PlaintiffRespondent closed his case on 17122013 as contained on page 16 of the record, the matter was adjourned to 2912014 for defence. The case came up on 2942014 where it was adjourned at the instance of the DefendantAppellant to 562014. That on the said date, both DefendantsAppellants and their Counsel were absent and the matter was adjourned to a date both counsel agreed on. That Counsel agreed to go back on 2992014 for defence. That on the said date, the DefendantsAppellants and their Counsel were absent and the matter was further adjourned to 15102014 and hearing notice was served on their Counsel.  It is submitted that on the said 15102014, Defence Counsel appeared and told the Court that his client not witness was unable to make it, the matter was adjourned to 4112014 for the last time for defence.  That on 4112014, both the DefendantsAppellants and their Counsel were absent, the Court foreclosed them.  It is submitted that the Appellants were given reasonable opportunity to enter their defence but failed to do so. He referred to Umaru v. Tunga 2012 ALL FWLR Pt. 607 726 at 740 paragraph E where it was held: “Where a Court created the enabling environment for fair hearing to all and a party did not take advantage of the environment, the fault is his and not that of the Court. In instance case, where the Defendant failed to take the opportunity created by the trial Court to present his case the allegation of breach of fair hearing was discountenanced by the Court.\"  On the complaint in respect of the mode of execution of the judgment by the trial Area Court, it is submitted that the Appellant had the right to Appeal within 30 days but did not do that. That there is no law that says the judgment creditor must wait until 30 days for the aggrieved party to Appeal before the judgment is executed.  That Order 17 Rule 2 of the Area Court Civil Procedure Rules, 1971 permits the Judge to make a special order for immediate execution; and that was what the trial judge did based on the application of the Judgment CreditorRespondents contained on page 29 of the Record. That Order 19 Rule 4 provides for a five day window period between execution of a judgment and auction sale. It is submitted that while execution was levied on 241214, auction sale was conducted on 311214 a period of seven days over and above the statutory requirement of five days minimum.  On issue three, it was submitted that the trial Court was right to have granted the PlaintiffRespondents reliefs sought, as he led evidence through PW1 and PW2 in support of his claims. That evidence was led on the grader hired at N80, 000 per day for 12 days totaling N690, 000, that evidence was led on the hiring of excavator at N110,000 per day times 11 days totaling N1,210,000.00. That evidence was led on the payment made to the Plaintiff totaling N500,000 leaving an unpaid balance of N1,670,000 which is the amount in respect of which judgment was entered. According to Counsel, cases are decided on preponderance of evidence and balance of probabilities relying on Sterling Bank Plc. v. Falola 2015 ALL FWLR Pt. 774 5.  That the Respondent has discharged the burden as expected of him before the trial Upper Area Court. According to Counsel, there is no material contradiction in the names of Isiah and Isaac. That Robinson Isiah is the project manager of the 2nd Appellant while Isiah is the site manager. He referred to the case of Taiwo v. Ogundele 2012 ALL FWLR Pt. 639 Page 1033 at 1048 Paragraphs F-G and urged the Court to resolve the third issue in favour of the Respondent and dismiss the Appeal.  RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL I will determine this Appeal based on the three issues formulated by the Appellant which are similar on all fours with those formulated by the Respondent.   On issue one - whether the lower Court was right when it held that the trial Upper Area Court had jurisdiction over the second Appellant a non natural person, it is important to refer to Section 12 1abc of the Area Court Law Cap 11 Laws of Adamawa State 1987 which provides:- 121Subject to the provision of this Edict and any other written Law, the following persons shall be subject to the jurisdiction of Area Courts: a Any person whose parents were members of any tribe or tribes indigenous to some part of Africa and the descendants of any such person; b Any person one of whose parents was a member of such tribe; c Any person in a cause or matter in which he consents to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Area Court.  In the instant case, a careful look at the record of proceedings of the trial Upper Area Court contained at Pages 4 -30 of the Printed Record, the AppellantsDefendants consented and submitted to the jurisdiction of the trial Upper Area Court by participating in the proceedings through their Counsel Ehimikhua Esq., who appeared on their behalf and even cross-examined PW1 and PW2 the RespondentPlaintiffs witnesses. Section 12 1c Area Court Law Cap 11 Laws of Adamawa State ,1987 was therefore complied with by the trial Upper Area Court. The lower Court was therefore right when it held that the Upper Area Court had the jurisdiction to determine the Suit. Issue one is therefore resolved in favour of the Respondent and against the Appellants.  Issue two is whether the lower Court was right when it held that the Respondents were accorded fair hearing. The grouse of the AppellantsDefendants is that the Upper Area Court foreclosed them from entering their defence and that when the Upper Area Court delivered its judgment on 231214 instead of 181114; it ought to have put them on notice. On the issue of denying the Appellants their Constitutional right to enter their defence, it is trite that a Court should give parties reasonable time to present their case before it. If the Court affords parties the opportunity to present their case before it, any party that fails to utilize such opportunity cannot complain of lack of hearing. Page 16 of the Printed Record shows that when the RespondentPlaintiff closed his case on the 171213 the case was adjourned to 29114 for defence. On the returned date, it was further adjourned to 40314 for defence, again adjourned to 180314, 29414 and 50614 for defence. On 50614, it was adjourned to 290914 and hearing notice ordered to be served on the AppellantsDefendants. On 29092014 case was adjourned to 151014. On the said date, AppellantDefendants Counsel applied for another date for defence. It was adjourned to 4112014. On the returned date neither the AppellantsDefendants nor their Counsel was in Court and the Court adjourned the case to 181114 for judgment. From 171213 to 41114 when the Upper Area Court adjourned for judgment is a period of almost a year but still the AppellantsDefendants were not able to present their defence. In the case of Umaru v. Tunga 2012 ALL FWLR Part 607 726 at 740 it was held that:- Where a Court created the enabling environment for fair hearing to all and a party did not take advantage of the environment, the fault is his and not that of the Court. In the instant case, where the Defendant failed to use the opportunity created by the trial Court to present his case the allegation of breach of fair hearing was discountenanced by the Court.  The lower Court was therefore on a sound footing when it held in its judgment reflected on Page 72 of the Printed Record that the trial Court was right to foreclose the AppellantsDefendants after giving them several adjournments to enter their defence but failed to do so.   On the issue that the lower Court adjourned the case to 181114 for judgment but did not deliver same until 231214 without hearing notice served on the AppellantsDefendants; from the Printed Record at Pages 21-28 it is shown that on 41114, the case was adjourned to 181114 for judgment. On the return date, the Court did not sit to deliver the judgment. The judgment which is contained at Pages 22-28 of the Printed Record was delivered on 231214. The RespondentPlaintiff was represented by Counsel, while the AppellantsDefendants were not in Court nor were they represented by Counsel. The issue for determination is what is the effect of delivering the judgment of the trial Upper Area Court after the scheduled date without notice to the AppellantsRespondents? In the case of Cotecna International Ltd. v. Church Gate Nig. Ltd. 2011 ALL FWLR Pt. 575 261 at 262, the Supreme Court held: “It would appear to me and I am of the view that the delivery of judgment earlier than scheduled date without notice to the Appellant will not nullify the judgment unless the Appellant show that it has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The Appellant has not shown that any miscarriage of justice has occasioned because its counsel was not present when the judgment was read. It is not shown that if the Appellant counsel had listened to the judgment which was delivered in open Court, the decision could have been otherwise.”  In the instant case, the Appellants have not shown that the delivery of the judgment on a later date of 231214 rather than the earlier date of 181114 without hearing notice to them had occasioned any miscarriage of justice to them; or that the judgment which was delivered in open Court could have been otherwise if the Appellants or their counsel had listened to it. Furthermore, in the case of Veritas Insurance Company Ltd. v. Citi Trust Investment Ltd. 1993 3 NWLR Pt. 281 363 this Court held: Parties and or their counsel sit in Court and listen to the judgment being delivered. They do not play any role beyond listening and at times taking down random notes in the course of the delivery of the judgment. Some do not take notes, they just listen and leave Court at the end of the judgment with the usual clich “as the Court pleases” even when the pleasure of the Court is not the pleasure of the party who lost the case. Perhaps the position should have been different if the matter was at the stage of physically taking evidence or at the point of address.  The second issue is therefore resolved in favour of the Respondent and against the Appellants.  The third issue for determination is whether the lower Court was right when it held that the Respondent proved his case before the trial Upper Area Court. The claims of the RespondentPlaintiff before the trial Upper Area Court as reflected at Page 23 of the Printed Record are as follows:- a The sum of N1,670,000 being the outstanding balance remaining unpaid from the hire and use of the Plaintiffs two 2 construction machines. b 10% interest on the judgment sum.  The evidence of the RespondentPlaintiff contained at Page 8 of the Printed Record shows that the 1st Appellant went to the Respondent and hired an excavator and a grader. The grader was hired for 12 days at N80,000 per day making the total money to N960,000. The excavator was hired at N110,000 per day for 11 days which totals N1,120,000. That the sum total is N2,170,000.00. That the 1st Appellant paid to the Respondent N500,000, leaving the unpaid balance of N1,670,000.00. This Court observes that the evidence of PW1 was not discredited during cross-examination as shown on page 12 of the printed record. The other complain of the Appellant is that while the Respondent as PW1 stated that at page 12 of the printed record that the name of the site engineer is Isaac, he called one Engineer Robinson Isaiah page 14-15 of the record with no explanation as to the two names. That PW1 also stated at pages 12-13 of the printed record that “besides this work which we did on credit there are other previous works which we did. I can’t remember how much was paid for the previous work we did for him. This was in 2012 but I can’t remember the money paid”. According to Counsel, these are material contradictions that go to the root of the Respondents claim before the trial Upper Area Court which it did not advert its mind to. On the side of the Respondent, it was argued that evidence was led as to the claims of the Respondent upon which the trial Court entered judgment in favour of the Respondent.  It is trite that contradictions in the evidence of witnesses may not necessarily be fatal to a case especially when they are minor, and the judgment of a trial Court will not be reversed on appeal because there were contradictions in the evidence of witnesses, it must also be shown that the Court did not advert its mind to those contradictions. See Taiwo v. Ogundele 2012 ALL FWLR Pt. 639 1033 at 1048 Paras. F-G.  In the instant case, the lower Court at Pages 71-72 of the Printed Record adverted its mind to the alleged material contradictions raised by the Appellants. The lower Court held:- “On issue four, it is the contention of the Appellant that the PlaintiffRespondent never proved his case His argument was that under cross examination PW1 testified that he wrote the name of the 1st defendant as Christopher as given to him, and the name of the Engineer as Isaac; but PW2 testified that the name of the Engineer is Robinson, and there was no attempt to clarify the name Robinson Isaiah and Isaac and yet the Court relied on their testimonies. In my view, the fact that there was misdescription of the said Engineer whether the surname was Isaac or Isaiah did not change the substance of the claim of the PlaintiffRespondent from the DefendantsAppellants. The claim of the PlaintiffRespondent is clear. It was for services of machineries hired by the DefendantAppellant which has not been settled for. For this reason, the PlaintiffRespondent has proved his claim as required by law, moreover, the DefendantsRespondents did not offer any defence for these claims at the trial Court.\"  As I stated earlier, the lower Court had adverted its mind to the alleged contradictions as highlighted above. This Court will not interfere with such finding of the lower Court since it is not perverse. The third issue is accordingly resolved in favour of the Respondent and against the Appellant. Having resolved the three issues against the Appellant, this Appeal lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. I affirm the judgment of the lower Court delivered on 19122016 which affirmed the decision of Upper Area Court 11, Yola. Parties to bear their respective costs.   CHIDI NWAOMA UWA, J.C.A.:  I read in advance a draft copy of the judgment of my learned brother, ABDULLAHI MAHMUD BAYERO, J.C.A., just delivered. I agree with my learned brothers reason and decision arrived at, that the Appeal is lacking in merit. I also dismiss the appeal for lacking in merit and abide by the order made as to costs in the leading judgment.   JAMES SHEHU ABIRIYI, J.C.A.:  I agree.-end!  " ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement "  OLUKAYODE ARIWOOLA, J.S.C. Delivering the Leading Judgment:  This is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Lagos Division delivered on the 7th day of February, 2014 affirming the decision of the trial Court, per the Honourable Justice F. O. Atilade delivered on the 16th day of February, 2007 except as to damages. The respondent was the claimant at the trial Court whilst the appellant was the defendant.  The gist of the case goes thus: By a writ of summons and Statement of Claim both dated 20th October, 2004, the respondent instituted an action against the appellant. In paragraph 18 of the Statement of Claim, the Claimant claims against the defendant as follows: a Damages for the breach of contract in the sum of N10million; b Damages for libel in the sum of N10million as per the defendants published defamation vide the cheque dated 14th November, 2003, on which the word account closed was written; c A full apology from the defendant to the Claimant. d Interest on the judgment sum at the rate of 10% per annum until final payment thereof.  The appellant as defendant in response filed a Statement of Defence dated 31082005 which was subsequently amended pursuant to an Order of Court so to do granted on 06112006.  The respondents case as Claimant was that he operated a current account with the appellant and on 14th November, 2003 while the said account was still in credit, he issued a cheque in the sum of thirty thousand Naira N30,000.00 in favour of one Dr. T. A. Bashorun. The said cheque was subsequently presented for payment by Dr. Bashorun to his bank - United Bank for Africa Plc for payment but the cheque was returned unpaid with the words ACCOUNT CLOSED endorsed on it.  The respondent had contended that the said endorsement on the cheque is not only a breach of contract but also libelous having been published to Dr. T. A. Bahorun and the staff of the UBA Plc when in fact he was not given notice of any such closure of his account with the appellant.  On the other hand, the appellants case was that the endorsement on the cheque which the respondent was complaining about was premised on the fact that the respondents account with it had earlier been closed and the notice of the said closure given to the respondent via a letter sent through a Registered post as contained in the agreement.  At the trial, which commenced on the 2nd day of May, 2005, the respondent as claimant testified and called one other witness. Four documents were tendered, admitted and marked Exhibits A-D. The appellant in its defence called three witnesses as DW1-DW3 and tendered couple of documents which were admitted and marked Exhibits W-K respectively.  At the conclusion of hearing, the trial Court ordered written addresses. Counsel filed and exchanged same which they respectively adopted on 18th December, 2006.  In its reserved considered judgment, the trial Court gave judgment for the respondent. The Court, inter alia, held as follows: It is in the light of the foregoing that I hereby enter judgment for the Claimant against the Defendant for damages in the sum of N2million comprising both nominal damages and damages in respect of the defendants liability for the libelous statement against the Claimant. It is further ordered that the defendant pays to the Claimant the sum of N200,000 as costs of litigating this suit and N2,000 costs of the defendants application dated the 18th October, 2006 respectively.  Being aggrieved, the appellant appealed to the Court below on five grounds. The appeal succeeded in part as pertains the amount awarded as damages and costs. The judgment of the trial Court was affirmed except as it relates to the award of damages in the sum of N2million and costs of N200,000 which was set aside.  The appellant was further aggrieved with the judgment of the Court below and has appealed to this Court on four grounds of appeal filed on 742014.  Subsequently, by an order of this Court granted on the 26th September, 2017, the Notice and Grounds of Appeal was amended and duly filed and served by the appellant.  In compliance with the Rules of this Court, briefs of argument were filed and exchanged by parties.  When the appeal came up for hearing on 4th November, 2019, Mr. Afolabi Kuti of counsel for the appellant identified appellants brief of argument filed on 30th October, 2017. He adopted and relied on same to urge the Court to allow the appeal.  Osayaba Giwa-Osagie Esq., of counsel for the respondent identified the respondents brief of argument filed on 23rd February, 2018 but deemed properly filed and served on 4th November, 2019. Learned counsel adopted and relied on same brief of argument to urge the Court to dismiss the appeal in its entirety.  In the appellant's brief of argument, the following three issues were distilled for the determination of the appeal: Issues for Determination: i Whether the required notice of account closure was duly given to the respondent by the appellant under and by virtue of the provisions of Section 643 of the Nigerian Postal Service Act. Distilled from Grounds 1 and 5 of the Amended Notice of Appeal. ii Whether on the state of the pleadings and evidence led, the lower Court was wrong in failing to uphold the defence of qualified privilege in the appellant's favour. Distilled from Grounds 2 and 3 of the Amended Notice of Appeal. iii Whether the respective sums awarded to the respondent by the lower Court as damages for breach of contract and for libel were justified in the peculiar circumstances of the case. Distilled from Ground 4 of the Amended Notice of Appeal.  The respondent also distilled three issues for determination of the appeal from the same five grounds of appeal contained in the Amended Notice and Grounds of Appeal filed by the appellant. The three issues for the respondent are the same though couched differently but from the same respective grounds. The issues in the appellants brief of argument shall however be used in determining this appeal. Issue 1  Whether the required notice of account closure was duly given to the respondent by the appellant under and by virtue of the provisions of Section 643 of the Nigerian Postal Service Act.  Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the Nigeria Postal Service Act, Cap N127, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004  hereinafter referred to as NIPOST Act is the governing law regulating postal services in the country, as well as delivery of articles by post. He referred to Section 643 of the NIPOST Act, in particular Subsections 3a and b and contended that in the interpretation of Statutory Provisions, the words used in a Statute should be given their ordinary meaning. He relied on International Bank for West Africa Ltd. Vs Imano Nig. Ltd & Anor 1988 3 NWLR Pt.85 633 at 660. He contended further that parties are not allowed to import extraneous matters into the provisions of a Statute under the guise of interpretation. He cited AG, Anambra State Vs. Attorney General of the Federation 2007 5-6 SC 192; Theophilous Vs. FRN 2012 LPELR  984 CA.  Learned counsel contended that the main issue in dispute between the parties borders on whether the appellant gave the required notice to the respondent before the closure of the respondents account under the contract between the parties. It is the contention of the appellant that the respondent did not deny the dispatch of notice of account closure in his pleadings. Learned counsel referred to the appellants specific allegation in the amended Statement of Defence that the notice of closure was dispatched to the respondent on October 15, 2003 vide a letter dated September 22, 2003 and that same was received by one Stanley U.K. on the respondents behalf. But that nowhere in the respondents pleadings is there a categorical denial that the notice of closure of his account was dispatched to him in accordance with the relevant terms of the contract between the parties.  Learned counsel referred to paragraph 14 of the respondents statement of claim and paragraph 8 of the appellants amended statement of Defence on the issue of dispatch of the Notice to the respondent. He contended that it is not in dispute that the respondent did not file a Reply to controvert the allegation contained in paragraph 8 of the amended Statement of Defence. That the averment in paragraph 14 of the respondents statement of claim is not a material averment of fact but a legal argument. He submitted that it is not a denial of the appellants averment in paragraph 8 of the Amended Statement of Defence. And that not having denied the allegation is an admission of the fact. He referred to Order 15 Rule 51 of the Old High Court of Lagos State Civil Procedure Rules, 2004 under which the parties pleadings were filed.  On the need to file a Reply to the Statement of Defence by a plaintiff in answer to certain facts in the defence which were not in the Statement of Claims he relied on Chief PTS Tende & Ors Vs. Attorney General of the Federation & Ors 1988 1 NWLR Pt.71 506 at 517. Meridien Trade Corp Ltd Vs. Metal Construction W.A Ltd 1998 LPELR  1862 SC.  Learned counsel submitted that having failed to file a Reply to controvert the specific allegation in the amended Statement of Defence, that the notice of Closure of account was sent to him by registered post, the respondent is deemed to have admitted the act. He contended that any evidence offered by the respondent to the contrary goes to no issue being founded on unpleaded facts. He relied on Dalek Nig Ltd Vs. OMPADEC 2007 7 NWLR Pt.1033 402 at 429430.  On the uncontroverted evidence of dispatch of the notice of account closure to the respondent by post, learned counsel referred to Exhibit C, the Account Opening Form. He referred to Clauses 7 & 8 thereof and contended that the appellant complied with the requirements in the said contract terms. He referred to the testimony of DW3 who was a mail room supervisor and the dispatch booklet Exhibit J to show that the said letter of notice of closure of account was dispatched to the Post Office on October 15, 2003.  He submitted that all that the appellant was required to show to justify the closure of the account under the contract and in law was that the letter of notice was dispatched to the respondents address at the Nigerian Postal Service NIPOST that is, that the letter was sent by registered post within the 7 day period before the account was closed. He relied on Daily Times Nig Plc. Vs. Amaizu 1999 12 NWLR Pt.631 439 at 457.  On the position of the law on registered post, learned counsel submitted that the placing or delivering of an article to an officer of the Postal Service in the course of his duties shall be deemed to be delivery to the addressee. He referred to the provisions of Section 64 3 again of the NIPOST Act. He also referred again to Clause 8 of the contract between the parties as contained in the account Opening Form Exhibit C, wherein the respondent agreed that any notice or letter addressed to him and sent through post at the address supplied by him shall be considered as delivered to and received by him at the time it would be delivered in the ordinary course of post, and must be read in conjunction with the provisions of Section 643 of the Nigerian Postal Service Act.  Learned counsel contended that having delivered the notice of closure of the respondents account to the post office on October 15, 2003, the respondent cannot be heard to complain that he was not served with the notice or letter contrary to the clear forms of the contract between the parties. He stated that the appellant waited for a month after the notice was sent before proceeding to close the respondents account on November 14, 2003. He submitted that the appellant accordingly gave the respondent the required 7-day notice before closing his account in compliance with clause 7 of the contract.  On the interpretation the Court below gave to Section 643 of the NIPOST ACT, learned counsel contended that the Court erroneously interpreted the provision by importing extraneous provisions into it. He referred to the findings of the Court below on pages 169-170 of the record. He contended that nowhere in clauses 7 and 8 of the contract and Section 643 of the Act is it provided that collection of the notice or letter from the post office is a condition precedent to closure of the respondents account by the appellant. He submitted that the lower Court was duty bound to give ordinary simple meaning and interpretation to the clear provisions of the Act. He relied on International Bank for West Africa, Ltd Vs. Imano Nig Ltd & Anor 1988 3 NWLR Pt.85 685.   Learned counsel further submitted that parties are bound by the clear terms of their contract and the Court is bound to construe the terms of the contract and cannot rewrite a new contract for the parties. He relied on Arjay Ltd Vs. Airline Management Support Ltd 2003 7 NWLR Pt.820 577 at 634.  He submitted that the appellant gave the respondent the required 7 day notice before his account was closed. Hence the appellant did not breach the contract with the respondent. Learned counsel urged the Court to hold that the required notice of account closure was duly given to the respondent by the appellant under and by virtue of the provisions of Section 643 of the NIPOST and the contract terms. Issue one is consequently answered in the affirmative.  In treating issue No. 1 by the respondent, learned counsel for the respondent contended that the starting point for determining whether requisite notice was given to the respondent before the closure of his account is the agreement of the parties. He submitted that a determination of whether or not requisite notice was given to the respondent is the central issue in this appeal.  Learned counsel referred to clauses 7 and 8 of the Account Opening Form constituting the contract of parties. He contended that, while clause 7 requires 7 days notice to be given after delivery before the closure of the account, clause 8 provides that any notice or letter will be considered delivered and received by the respondent at the time it would be delivered in the ordinary course of post. He submitted that from the two clauses of the contract, it is the time at which the notice or letter is delivered that is material to a determination of whether requisite notice was given and not the manner of delivery.  Learned counsel contended that evidence ought to have been led, in order to comply with Articles 7 & 8 of the contract, that in the ordinary course of post, a letter or notice sent through post would be delivered to the respondents address at a particular time, for instance, one week, two weeks, four weeks or six weeks. Therefore, a determination of whether closure of the account can only be made upon ascertaining when delivery according to the contract was made. He submitted that it is not the date it was delivered to the post office or received by the respondent that matters but the time it is deemed to have been delivered in the ordinary course of post to the respondent. He stated that there was no evidence of this time. He submitted that the two Courts below were right in agreeing with the respondent that Section 643 of the NIPOST Act is inapplicable because the provision deals with the manner of delivery of postal articles and not the time delivery is deemed to have been made. He contended that the provisions in the Act is different from the intendment of the provision of Clauses 7 and 8 of the Contract and therefore irrelevant to a determination of this appeal. He urged the Court to disregard the arguments contained in paragraphs 4.1-4.4 of the appellants brief of argument.  In response to paragraphs 4.5-4.14 of the appellants brief, learned counsel contended that by paragraph 14 of the respondents statement of claim, the allegation that no notice was given before the closure of the account was put in issue. He referred to paragraph 14 of the Statement of Claim, the allegation that no notice was given before the closure of the account was put to issue. He submitted that the pleading put into contention whether notice was given or not.  Learned counsel contended that to the extent that the said paragraph 8 of the amended Statement of Defence responded to the respondents allegation that no notice was dispatched and received, the respondent had no further obligation to reply or deny that he did not receive the said notice. Issues had become joined at that point for a judicial determination.  He contended that the appellant is wrong to have submitted that just because the respondent did not react to the appellant denial, such non response amounted to an admission. He submitted that the import of paragraph 14 of the respondents statement of claim is that the respondent did not receive any notice of closure of the account. He relied on Ishola Vs. SGB Nig Ltd 1997 2 NWLR Pt.488 405; Bakare Vs. Ibrahim 1973 6 SC 205; Akeredolu Vs. Akinremi 1989 3 NWLR Pt.108 164.  Learned counsel submitted that it is not in all cases that a reply is necessary. Where a plaintiff has already raised issue of fact in his pleading which constitutes a rebuttal of the defendants pleading on the issue, no further reply is needed. He urged the Court to discountenance the arguments and submissions of the appellant on this point in paragraphs 4.5-4.14 of the appellants brief.  Learned counsel contended that the appellant did not provide abundant and uncontroverted evidence of dispatch of the notice of account closure to the respondent by post. He referred to paragraphs 4.15-4.34 of the appellants brief of argument and submitted again that the provisions of S.643 of the NIPOST Act is not applicable to this matter because the section only provides for the method or manner of delivery of an article of post which will be deemed as delivery under the Act. He contended that to determine whether there was delivery, recourse must be had to the contract as the manner of delivery is not the relevant consideration in determining delivery but the time of delivery as required by the contract. He submitted that the evidence of dispatch does not, under the contract constitute evidence of delivery as delivery must be determined in relation to the time it would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.  Learned counsel contended that phrase in the ordinary course of post appearing in the contract of the parties has its technical meaning. It must mean the time it ordinarily takes to deliver such letters without intervening circumstances such as strikes, riots, natural disasters, civil and disorderly situations inhibiting delivery. He submitted that the phrase cannot mean mere delivery to the postman or placing such an item in a collection box. He relied on Section 26 of the Interpretation Act, Cap 123 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.  Learned counsel submitted that the term in the ordinary course of post comes with a specific time in the postal business, evidence of which ought to have been led by the appellant in order to determine delivery date and calculate period of notice of closure.  Learned counsel contended that it is in evidence that whereas the letter dated September 22, 2003 was delivered to the postal service on October, 15, 2003, the said letter did not get to the respondents alleged agent until November, 28, 2003. The account was closed on November 14, 2003. This piece of evidence was not rebutted by the appellant. He submitted that this in itself rebuts any evidence of proper closure of accounts with proper notice to the respondent.  He urged the Court to resolve this issue in favour of the respondent and dismiss the appeal on this ground.  Issue one for determination of this appeal is whether the required notice of account closure was duly given to the respondent by the appellant under and by virtue of the provisions of Section 643 of the Nigerian Postal Service Act?  From the available evidence, certain facts are not in dispute having been clearly admitted by parties or not specifically denied. They are therefore established. These facts are: - The appellant is a banking institution with an international outreach both in its operations and its composition. - The respondent was operating a current account No.8208018 with the appellant and the said account was always in credit at all times material to the institution in this suit. - Sometime on 14th November, 2003, the respondent had written a cheque on the said bank account in the sum of N30,000.0-0 Thirty Thousand Naira only in favour of one Dr. T. A. Bashorun. - The said cheque duly presented through his own bankers - UBA Plc by Dr. Bashorun for payment by the appellant was returned unpaid with the following endorsement on the said cheque  Account closed. - That as at the 14th November, 2003 when the respondents said current bank account with the respondent was closed, it had a balance of N957,439.02 standing to the respondents credit which upon closure was transferred to a floating account. - The parties relationship was guided among others by the General Terms and Conditions applicable to the account. - As at the time Dr. Bashorun presented the respondents cheque to the appellant through his bank, - UBA Plc, the respondents account had been closed.  It is also very clear from the record that the appellant relied on the terms and conditions contained in the account Opening Form which the respondent subscribed to at the opening of the current account in question. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the said Account Opening Form read thus: 7. That the Bank may at any time with at least 7 days notice to me close my account whether it be in debit or in credit. 8. Any notice or letter addressed to me and sent through post at the address supplied by me shall be considered as delivered to and received by me at the time it would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.\"  It is the case of the respondent that he had no notice from the appellant that his account was to be closed. But the appellant contended that the respondent was duly notified in writing before the closure of his account in compliance with the terms of the contract between them.  The trial Court, on the issue of notice to the respondent of the closure of his account with the appellant, had found as follows: The claimant has indeed been unequivocal to the effect that he never received any notice from the defendant informing him of the said account closure. Thus, it is in my view of little relevance that the Claimant did not file a Reply and thus dispensed with the opportunity to specifically address the issue raised by the defendant per paragraphs 8 and 16 of its defence. The defendant had by their processes and in the course of the testimonies of DW1 & 2 tendered evidence to the effect that they had issued and dispatched the requisite notice on time and that it had in fact, been received on the Claimants behalf by one Stanley U.K.  However, due cognizance must be had to the fact that while the Claimants account was closed on the 14th November, 2003, the purported Notice of Account Closure was according to Exhibit J the Acknowledgment slip, received on the Claimants behalf by Stanley U.K on the 28 November, 2003, a clear period of two 2 weeks after the defendant effected the account closure in exercise of its discretion pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 7 of Exhibit C the Account Opening Form.  It is also pertinent to observe here that in the course of cross-examination, the claimant as PW1, had averred that he had never heard of any Stanley U.K. and could not have authorized this fictitious paragon to collect any documents on his behalf.  Unfortunately, no evidence was led to establish a contrary position.  From the above findings of the trial Court, it came to the conclusion that the appellant was in breach of contract for failure to notify the respondent before effecting the closure of his account.  On appeal to the Court below, the Court on the above point of the notice to the respondent for the closure of his account found, inter alia, as follows: Though the respondent denied ever receiving any notice of closure either personally or through Stanley U.K. whom he has never met. But the appellant adduced documentary evidence to show that the letter notifying the respondent about the plan to close his account was collected from the post office by one Stanley U.K on the 28112003. It is also the evidence of the appellant that the appellants sic respondents account was closed on 14112003. It follows therefore that even if it is taken that the notice of closure of account was received by the respondent through one Stanley U. K. on 28112003 as contended by the appellant. There is however a glaring evidence also from the appellant that the said notice was handed to and received by the said Stanley U.K. two weeks after the respondents account was close on 14112003.  Consequently, the appellant is in breach of clause 7 of the agreement Exhibit C which provides for the giving of at least 7 days notice, to the respondent before his account can be closed.  From the above findings, the Court below found in favour of the respondent that no notice was given to him before his account with the appellant was closed. That led to the instant appeal by the appellant.  It is noteworthy that the appellant has strongly relied on Section 643 of the Nigerian Postal Service Act to support its contention that adequate notice was given to the respondent of the pending closure of his current account with the appellant.  As earlier stated, both parties had agreed to be bound by the terms of the agreement contained in the Account Opening Form. See paragraphs 7 & 8 of the form  Exhibit C.  In the respondents Statement of Claim, he had averred as follows:  The claimant shall contend that irrespective of the said terms and conditions, the defendant have sic no right in law to close the said account without giving notice of same to the Claimant, particularly even after the said accounts were closed unilaterally.  On the issue of dispatch of the notice to the respondent, the appellant specifically pleaded in paragraph 8 of its amended Statement of Defence as follows: In their natural and ordinary meaning, the said words are true in substance and fact  Particulars: a By virtue of a written contract dated 16th September, 1999, the defendant had the power to unilaterally close the claimants account. b Pursuant to paragraph a above, a letter dated 22nd September, 2003, the defendant issued and caused to be dispatched on 15th October, 2003 by registered post to the claimant a notice of closure which was received by one Stanley U.K. c On 14th November, 2003, a month after the notice was sent, the claimants account was closed.  The law is indeed settled, that the placing or delivery of an article to an officer of the Postal Service in the course of hisher duties shall be deemed to be delivered to the addressee. Section 643 of the Nigerian Postal Service Act provides as follows: “The placing or delivery  a of an article in any receiving box for the deposit of postal article, or delivery of an article to an officer of the Postal Service in the course of his duties; or b the delivery of a postal article at the house or office, private mail bag, and private letter box of the addressee or to the addressee or to his servant or agent or other person considered to be authorized to receive the article according to the usual manner of delivering post articles to the addressee and where the addressee is a guest or is resident at a hotel, delivery to the proprietor or manager therefore or to his agents, shall be deemed to be delivery to the addressee.”  Furthermore, by the provisions of the above Postal Service Act, postal articles include any letter, postcard, newspaper, book document, pamphlet, pattern or sample packet, parcel or package or other article whatsoever transmissible by post.\"  Generally, the law guiding transmission of articles by post is the Nigerian Postal Service Act. Hence, clause 8 of the contract duly entered into by parties in this case must be read in conjunction with the provisions of the Nigerian Postal Service Act. In other words, I agree with the appellant that the clear emphasis in clause 8 is delivery of the notice or letter to the respondent by post. That is, that the appellant shall dispatch the notice of closure of the respondents account through NIPOST. By clause 8 of the contract, the respondent agreed that notice sent to him through post shall be considered as delivered and received by him at the time it would be delivered in this ordinary course of post. This means that by the provisions of Section 643 of the NIPOST Act, delivery of an article to an officer of the NIPOST in the course of his duties shall be deemed to be delivery to the addressee. In other words, I agree with the appellant that the Court below erred when it held that any notice or letter sent through the post to the respondent shall be deemed to have been delivered to him upon same being handed over to him in the course of ordinary post, and whereby registered post, upon such letter being signed for and collected from the postal officials. There is nowhere in clauses 7 and 8 of the terms and conditions of the agreement it is provided that collection of the notice or letter from the post office is a condition precedent to closure of the respondents account by the appellant.  From the terms and conditions of the agreement and the available evidence, I agree entirely that the respondent was given the required notice before the closure of his account. In the result, the appellant is not in breach of the contract between the parties. There is evidence that the letter of the appellant notifying the respondent of the plan to close his account was duly dispatched in the ordinary course of post, to NIPOST and this was not specifically controverted or disputed by the respondent. The notice sent to the respondent by post is deemed delivered to him at such time it would be deemed delivered in the ordinary course of post.  In the result, issue one is resolved in favour of the appellant. The respondent was given the required notice of account closure in compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract and the applicable provisions of the NIPOST Act.  Second issue is whether on the state of the pleadings and evidence led, the lower Court was wrong in failing to uphold the defence of qualified privilege in the appellants favour.  The words complained of by the respondent as being defamatory are written on the cheque issued by the respondent in favour of one Dr. T. A. Bashorun. The appellant admitted having written the said words, but claimed the defence of qualified privilege in communicating such alleged defamatory words. The respondent had pleaded in paragraph 9 of its amended Statement of Defence on pages 46-69 of the Record as follows:  Further or alternatively, if though the said words were construed to be defamatory, the defendant shall contend that the said words were published on an occasion of qualified privilege. Particulars: a The claimant is an account holder with the defendant; b The United Bank for Africa is a Limited liability Company which carries out the business of providing financial services. c The defendant and UBA are in the same line of business. They are required by the regulator i.e. the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN to disclose certain information in respect of interbank transactions. d The defendant wrote and published the words complained of in compliance with the requirements of CBN and in the reasonable protection of its duty to UBA which had a reciprocal duty and or interest to receive it. e UBA carries out its function through its team of staff hired to carry out different functions and handle various transactions. The defendant published the words complained of to the staff of United Bank for Africa in the ordinary course of business. In the banking industry, any publication to a member of staff is considered privileged information and therefore protected by an original qualified privilege.  The appellant contended that in proof of the above averment in its pleadings, it gave credible evidence on its defence of qualified privilege. DW1 testified as follows: The usual practice and requirement in the banking industry particularly in respect of the cheque transactions is that when a bank is unable to conclude a transaction, the reason for such an inability is endorsed on the cheque.  The appellant contended that it had a dutyinterest in making the communication and the UBA Plc to whom the communication was directly made also had a corresponding interest in having it made. Hence, the occasion in which the communication was made was an occasion of qualified privilege.  In its judgment, the trial Court found that the defence of qualified privilege was not sustainable for the appellant.  On appeal to the Court below, the Court had stated in its judgment that having found that due notice was not given to the respondent before the closure of his account by the appellant and that the consequent endorsement on the cheque with words Account closed was in breach of clause 7 of Exhibit C - the agreement between the two parties, it follows that the publication of the words in the said cheque to Dr. T. A. Bashorun and the staff of the United Bank for Africa Plc which constitute libel cannot justify a defence of qualified privilege as raised by the appellant. The Court of appeal found that the endorsement is defamatory as the imputation therein was to the discredit of the respondent which cannot be justified with the defence of qualified privilege.  Generally, a privileged occasion arises if the communication is of such a nature that it could be fairly said that those who made it had an interest in making a communication and those to whom it was made had a corresponding interest in having it made to them. Where these two co-exist, the occasion is privileged. See; Giwa Vs. Ajayi 1993 5 NWLR Pt.294 423, Ugo Vs. Okafor 1996 3 NWLR Pt.438 542; Ojeme Vs. Momodu 1994 1 NWLR Pt.323 685; Iloabachie Esq. Vs. Benedict N. Iloabachie 2005 LPELR  1492 SC.  As earlier stated, what the respondent considered which the two Courts below found to be libelous were the words –                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \"Account closed” endorsed on the cheque issued by the respondent to a third party Dr. Bashorun who presented same to his own banker the UBA Plc for clearing. There is no dispute as to whether or not the appellant wrote those words and published it to Dr. Bashorun and the staff of the UBA Plc., but the appellant had contended that as a bank, it owed it as a duty to a sister bank the UBA Plc to disclose to it the reason for its failure to honour the cheque of the respondent. The reason being that the account had been closed before the cheque was presented, hence could not be honoured. In which case the bank UBA Plc, to whom the said alleged libelous statement or words were made had interest in receiving the reason for failure to honour the cheque.   I respectively disagree with the Court below when it held that the endorsement on the cheque was defamatory and that the imputation was to the discredit of the respondent.  In this case, the appellant had pleaded and called evidence to show that the occasion of the alleged defamation was privileged in that it owed it a duty to the sister bank to whom the cheque was returned to know why the appellant could no longer process the cheque and the reason is, as stated on the said cheque  the account was already closed, even though before its closure it was in credit. The law is that there must exist a common interest between the maker of the statement and the person to whom it was made. Reciprocity of interest is an essential element in the law of qualified privilege. See; Adam Vs. Ward 1917 A. C. 09 at 334; Ademola Atoyebi Vs. William Odudu 1990 6 NWLR Pt.157 384 at 405; 1990 LPELR  594 SC.  However, the facts relied upon by the maker must be true to sustain the defence of qualified privilege. See; Hebditch Vs. Macllwaine 1844 2 QB 54.  It is trite law that in order to debunk or destroy the defendants defence of fair comment or qualified privilege, a plaintiff must file a reply to specifically plead and call credible evidence of malice in the defendant. The respondent herein neither file a reply to plead any element of malice in the appellant in endorsing the alleged defamatory words.  It is noteworthy that the respondent herein did not file any reply to the amended statement of defence, earlier alluded to wherein the appellant pleaded the defence and called credible evidence to support the defence. By the state of the pleadings and the evidence led, I am satisfied that the appellant is covered with the defence of qualified privilege. The lower Court was therefore wrong to have failed to uphold the defence in favour of the appellant. The issue is accordingly resolved in favour of the appellant.  The third issue is whether the respective sums awarded to the respondent by the lower Court as damages for breach of contract and for libel were justified in the peculiar circumstances of this case. Having held that there was no breach of contract between the parties in this case in that the appellant complied with the provisions of clauses 7 and 8 of the contract in the account opening form in conjunction with the provisions of Section 643 of the NIPOST Act as the required notice of account closure was given to the respondent by the appellant, and the alleged defamatory words endorsed on the cheque was covered by qualified privilege, it is no longer necessary to consider the award of damages to the respondent.  In the final analysis, the issues considered are hereby resolved in favour of the appellant but against the respondent. The appeal therefore succeeds in its entirety and it is allowed.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court below delivered on 752014 is set aside.  Parties are to bear their respective costs.  Appeal allowed.   OLABODE RHODES-VIVOUR, J.S.C.:  I had the advantage of reading a draft copy of the leading judgment just delivered by my learned brother, ARIWOOLA JSC. I agree with His Lordship's reasons and conclusion.  I also allow the appeal.   KUDIRAT MOTONMORI OLATOKUNBO KEKERE-EKUN, J.S.C.:  I have had the benefit of reading before now, the judgment of my learned brother, Olukayode Ariwoola, JSC, just delivered. His Lordship has meticulously considered and ably resolved the issues in contention in this appeal. I agree with the reasoning and conclusion that there is merit in the appeal and it should be allowed.  The facts of this case illustrate the sanctity of contractual terms between parties and the need to always read \"the fine print.\" It is not in dispute that the contract between the parties was contained in the Account Opening form, Exhibit C, which provided in paragraphs 7 and 8 thus: \"7. The Bank may, at any time with at least 7 days notice to me close my account, whether it be in debit or in credit 8. Any notice or letter addressed to me and sent through post at the address supplied by me shall be considered as delivered to and received by me at the time it would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.\"   How is delivery determined? The answer is to be found in 643 of the Nigerian Postal Service NIPOST Act Cap. N127 Laws of the Federation, 2004, which provides: \"The placing or delivery -  a Of an article in any receiving box for the deposit of postal article, or the delivery of an article to an officer of the Postal Service in the course of his duties; or b The delivery of a postal article at the house or office, private mail bag, and private letter box of the addressee or to the addressee or to his servant or agent or other person considered to be authorized to receive the article according to the usual manner of delivery postal articles to the addressee and where the addressee is a guest or is resident at a hotel, delivery to the proprietor or manager therefore or to his agent, shall be deemed to be delivery to the addressee.\"  The well-known canon of interpretation of statutes is that the words used must be given their natural and ordinary meaning unless such an approach would lead to absurdity. See: Ibrahim Vs Barde 1996 9 NWLR Pt.474 513 @ 577 B-C; Ojokolobo vs Alamu 1987 3 NWLR Pt.61 377: Adewumi vs A.G. Ekiti State & Ors. State & Ors. 2002 SCNJ 27 @ 50.   By the agreement between the parties, the appellant was entitled to close the respondent's account \"at any time\" \"with at least 7 days notice\" and \"whether the account is in debit or credit.\" Also by their agreement, any notice or letter addressed to him would be \"considered as delivered to and received\" by him at the time it would be delivered in the ordinary course of post. The ordinary course of post is as stipulated in Section 643 of the NIPOST Act. By the provisions of Section 643 of NIPOST Act and clause 8 of the agreement between the parties, the notice was deemed to have been delivered to him on 15102003 by registered post. This was the unchallenged evidence before the Court. There was also unchallenged evidence that the respondent's account was closed on 14112003, more than 7 days after the notice was delivered to him, in accordance with Clause 7 of Exhibit C.  He is bound by the terms of his contract. The lower Court was therefore wrong when it held that the respondent was not given the required notice before his account was closed.  On the issue of the defence of qualified privilege relied on by the appellant, it is a defence to an untrue publication. It can only be claimed when the occasion of the publication is shown to be privileged. See: Iloabachie vs Iloabachie 2005 13 NWLR Pt. 943 695: An occasion is said to be privileged where there is a common interest between the maker of the statement and the person to whom it was made. A privileged occasion is an occasion where the person who makes a communication has an interest or duty, legal social or moral, to write it to the person to whom it is made, and the person to whom it is made has a corresponding duty to receive it. See: Akomolafe Vs Guardian Press Ltd. Printers & Ors. 2010 3 NWLR Pt. 1181 338; Iloabachie vs Iloabachie supra; Atoyebi vs Odudu 1990 9-10 SC 150.  The defence of qualified privilege is a shield relied upon by a defendant where it is proved that the statement complained of is untrue. In the circumstances of this case, the statement that the respondent's account had been closed was true. In my considered view, the issue of qualified privilege did not arise.  For these and the more detailed reasoning in the lead judgment, I find this appeal to be meritorious. It is hereby allowed.  I abide by the consequential orders in the lead judgment including the order on costs.   AMIRU SANUSI, J.S.C.:  I read in advance the judgment just rendered by my learned brother Ariwoola, JSC. His Lordship had painstakingly and adequately addressed all the salient issues canvassed by learned counsel to the parties in this appeal before arriving at the inevitable conclusion that this appeal has merit and deserves to be allowed. I agree entirely with such reasoning and shall also allow the appeal.  I abide by the consequential orders made including one on costs.   EJEMBI EKO, J.S.C.:  I read in draft the judgment delivered in the appeal by my learned brother, OLUKAYODE ARIWOOLA, JSC. The judgment representing my views in the appeal is hereby endorsed and adopted by me.  I will however just add a few comments of mine on facts sufficiently summarised in the lead judgment. The Appellant and the Respondent had their contract in Exhibit C. By paragraph 7 of Exhibit C, the Respondent authorised the Appellant to, \"anytime within at least 7 days notice to me, close my account whether be it in debt or in credit.\"  By paragraph 8 of Exhibit C, the Respondent further statesprovides:- Any notice or letter addressed to me and sent through post at the address supplied by me shall be considered as delivered to and received by me at the time it would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.  The combined reading of paragraphs 7 and 8 of Exhibit C does not, in my view, envisage that the Appellant shall be burdened or obligated to prove actual delivery or receipt by the Respondent of any notice or latter sent to him by the Appellant through post. It is not in dispute that the parties to Exhibit C mutually agreed that the posting of notices or letters to the Respondent by the Appellant shall be by post-delivery. All the Appellant is obligated to prove is merely or only when the disputed letter or notice was posted as agreed.  At common law, a postal acceptance of an offer takes effect from when the letter containing the acceptance was posted. For this purpose, a letter is posted when it is put in the control of the post office, or one of its employees authorised to receive letters: CHITTY ON CONTRACT 29th Ed., Vol. 1, Para. 2.046, Page 145.  The common law Posting Rule, a rule of convenience so to say; is that once the letter is posted - that is, put in the control of the Post Office, there is presumption that it will reach the addressee and the onus is not on the addressor to ensure either that it was not lost or was in fact delivered: CHITTY ON CONTRACT supra at page 148, para 2053. This Posting Rule is what has been codified or enacted into Section 643 of the Nigerian Postal Service Act, Cap. N127, LFN 2004 - NIPOST Act providing 64. 3. The placing or delivery -  a. of an article in any receiving box for the deposit of postal articles, or the delivery of an article to an officer of the Postal Service in the course of his duties; or b. the delivery of a postal article at the house or office, private mail bag, and private letter box of the addressee or to the addressee or his servant or agent or other person considered to be authorised to receive the article according to the usual manner of delivering postal articles to the addresseeand where the addressee is a guest or is resident of a hotel, delivery to the proprietor or manager therefore or to his agent, shall be deemed to be delivery to the addressee.  Section 641 of the NIPOST ACT defines postal articles to include any letter, etc. By this definition postal article should include notices or letters sent by post. The letter posted or dispatched on 15th October, 2003, which letter conveyed to the Respondent, the notice of the closure of his account, by the Posting Rule, was deemed to have been delivered to the Respondent upon the same delivered to the NIPOST for delivery to the addressee, the Respondent, at the address furnished by him. I therefore agree with the Appellant that in view of Section 643 of the NIPOST Act read together with paragraphs 7 and 8 of Exhibit C, it is perverse of the lower Court to hold that the physical delivery, receipt or collection by the Respondent of the letternotice from the Appellant is a condition precedent for closure of Respondent's account with the Appellant.  The Respondent's account having been closed in terms of Exhibit C, it is reasonable for the Appellant to give \"account closed\" as the reason why the cheque drawn in favour of Dr. Bashorun could not be given cash value on the order of the Respondent. The Appellant's plea of qualified privilege applied in full force. The concurrent judgments of the two Courts below dismissing the plea are perverse and unreasonable in the circumstance.  With the success of issues 1 and 2 in favour of the Appellant, it follows naturally that Issue 3 be also, and is hereby resolved in favour of the Appellant. The appeal is allowed. All consequential orders made in the lead judgment are hereby adopted by me.-end! " ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary " The Plaintiff/Respondent instituted an action claiming against the defendant as follows: (a) Damages for the breach of contract in the sum of N10million; (b) Damages for libel in the sum of N10million as per the defendants published defamation vide the cheque dated 14th November, 2003, on which the word account closed was written; (c) A full apology from the defendant to the Claimant. (d) Interest on the judgment sum at the rate of 10% per annum until final payment thereof. The claim arose because the Claimant, operated a current account with the Appellant/Defendant bank and while the said account was still in credit, he issued a cheque in favour of a third party, which was presented for payment to the bank. However, the cheque was returned unpaid with the words “ACCOUNT CLOSED” endorsed on it. It was the contention of the respondent that the said endorsement on the cheque was not only a breach of contract but also libelous having been published to the third party and the staff of the UBA Plc when in fact he was not given notice of any such closure of his account with the appellant.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasJudgement " ITA GEORGE MBABA, J.C.A. Delivering the Lead Ruling:  AppellantApplicant filed a motion on 962016, seeking the following orders: 1 An Order granting leave to the applicant to file and argue fresh issues of customary law not raised at the Court below. 2 An order of Court deeming fresh issues of customary law contained in the notice of Appeal dated 15th day of September already filed and served as having been properly filed and served. 3 An order of Court granting leave to the appellant to further raise and argue fresh issues of customary law not raised at the Court below. 4 An Order of Court deeming fresh issues of customary law as contained in the amended notice of appeal already filed and served as having been properly filed and served. 5 An Order of Court granting to the Appellant to further raise and argue fresh issues that touch on jurisdiction not raised at the Court below. 6 An Order of Court deeming fresh issues that touch on jurisdiction as contained in the amended notice of Appeal already filed and served as having been properly filed and served. 7 An Order of Court granting leave to the appellant to amend the original notice of appeal dated 15th day of September, 2014 in the way and manner set out and underlined on the proposed amended notice of appeal annexed hereto as Exhibit A. 9 An Order of Court granting leave to the Appellant to amend the original notice of appeal dated 15th day of September, 2014 and filed on 23rd day of September, 2014 by adding additional grounds of appeal as set out and underlined on the proposed amended notice of appeal annexed hereto as Exhibit A. 10 An Order of Court deeming the amended notice of appeal already filed and served as having been properly filed and served. And for such order or further orders  The application was supported by the following grounds: a Recently after perusing the appellants notice of appeal, it was discovered by the appellants Counsel that he inadvertently omitted seeking the leave of the Court before filing fresh issues which were not raised at the Court below and which said fresh issues are contained in the notice of appeal, filed on 23rd day of September 2014. b That since the fresh issues have already been filed, it requires the leave of this Court to regularize them for the purpose of arguing them in this appeal. c Also recently, after perusing the appellants notice of appeal, it was further discovered by the appellants Counsel that certain material facts which bother on custom of the parties in this appeal were inadvertently omitted from the appellants notice of appeal, filed on 23rd day of September, 2014. d Also certain material facts which bother on the issue of jurisdiction of the trial customary Court were also inadvertently omitted from the appellants notice of appeal, filed on 23rd days of September, 2014. e By the case of Nwaigwe v. Okere 2008 12 NWLR Pt.1105 PG 445 at 477 PARA C  F, issue of jurisdiction of the Court to entertain matters brought before it is of universal application and applies to Customary Court. f By the case of Nwaigwe v. Okere Supra. Issue of jurisdiction of customary Court to hear and determine a matter can therefore be raised in a matter brought before a customary Court. g Ground 4 of the grounds of appeal raises the issue of locus standi and leave of this Court is necessary to file and argue the same.  The application was also supported by affidavit of several paragraphs, - 1, 2, 3, a - n, 4, 5 and 6, and one Exhibit Exhibit A.  The 1st Respondent, filed a counter affidavit to oppose the application and parties were ordered to file written addresses to articulate their arguments. AppellantApplicant filed his written Address on 962016, while the 1st Respondent filed his on 2518 and same was deemed duly filed on 4319.  Reply on points of law was filed on 20518, and was also deemed duly filed, on 4319.  Arguing the motion, Appellants Counsel, Kingsley Elegalam O. Esq., applied to withdraw the prayers 3,4,5,6 and 7 on the motion papers and urged us to strike out the same. What therefore remained of the motion, were the prayers for Order: 1 For leave to file and argue fresh issues of customary law not raised at the Court below; and 2 Deeming the fresh issues of customary law contained in the notice of appeal, dated 15th day of September sic already filed and served, as having been properly filed and served.  Counsel raised three issues for the determination of the Application, namely: 1 Whether in the circumstances of this case, this Court can grant leave to the AppellantApplicant to file and argue fresh issues of customary law, not raised at the Court below. 2 Whether in the circumstances of this case, this Court can grant leave to AppellantApplicant to amend his notice of appeal filed on the 23rd day of September 2014. 3 Whether in the circumstances of this case, this Court can grant leave to the appellantapplicant to amend his notice of appeal filed on the 23rd day of September 2014 by adding additional grounds of appeal.  Counsel answered all the posers in the affirmative. On the issue 1, Counsel referred us to grounds 1, 2 and 3 of the notice of appeal, filed on 2392014, which picked quarrel with the manner the trial customary Court evaluated the evidence before it, to conclude that appellant did not prove his title to the land in dispute. He argued: From the record of appeal before this Court, it does not admit, of any doubt that evidence was copiously led before the trial customary Court by both the appellant, and the respondent on the issues contained in the grounds 1, 2 and 3 herein above stated, which we are seeking the leave of this Honourable Court to file and argue. In other words, no further evidence is required to be led before this Honourable Court in order to argue them. Paragraph 4.05 of the Address.  He argued that the grounds 1 and 3, together with their particulars, raised the issue of the appellant being the only son of Mbagwu whose lands are being disputed and therefore, Mbagwus heir who is entitled to inherent Mbagwus Ishiobi, that is, the dwelling house and other lands belonging to Mbagwu, under native law and custom of Dikenafeiyi Autonomous Community where the parties come from.  Counsel relied the case of Alawiye v. Ogunsanya 2013 All FWLR Pt.668 800 as to what AppellantApplicant is required to do to raise fresh issue on appeal, not raised at the trial Court - namely: obtain the leave of the appellant Court; ensure the fresh points sought to be raised involve issue of substantive law, or procedural law which need to be allowed to prevent an obvious miscarriage of justice, and to show that no further evidence is required to resolve the issues for determination. He also relied Omotosho v. Ojo 2008 All FWLR Pt.408 389 at 399.  On issues 2 and 3, which Counsel argued, together, he said that this Court has the requisite discretion to grant leave for Appellant to amend his notice of appeal, filed on 23914 to incorporate the fresh issues, as set out in Exhibit A. He argued that the reason for the amendment sought are stated in Paragraphs 3d, 3e, 3f, 3g, 3h and 3i of the affidavit in support, which trace to the inadvertence andor mistake of Counsel who prepared the notice of appeal, filed on 23914; he said that the mistake of Counsel should not be visited on the appellant litigant. He relied on Opekun v. Sadiq 20035 NWLR Pt.814 475 at 489.  Counsel stated the propriety of amendment of notice of appeal, that it can be done at any stage of the proceeding, and relied on the case of Alawiye v. Ogunsanya supra.  Replying, the 1st Respondents Counsel, Chief E.O. Onyema, stated two issues for the determination of the application, as follows: 1 Whether, in the circumstances of this case, the AppellantApplicant is entitled to be granted leave to raise and argue the issues raised in grounds 1, 2 and 3 of the Appellants Notice of Appeal filed on 23916 sic. 2 Whether, in the circumstances of this case, the AppellantApplicant is entitled to be granted leave to file and argue the additional grounds of appeal, numbered as Grounds 10,11 and 12 in the proposed Amended Notice of Appeal?  Arguing the issue one, Counsel said the Customary Court had resolved the suit No.CCSM302006, filed by 1st Respondent, for him and awarded title to the five parcels of land in dispute to him, while dismissing suit No.CC5M572010 cross action by the Appellant; that Appellant had challenged that decision at the lower Court Customary Court of Appeal on four grounds, namely: a The trial Court did not apply the fair hearing rule b The trial Court was biased against the DefendantAppellant c The Ohalete family members constituted Judges in their own case. d The Court did not observe the Rule of fair hearing.  Counsel argued that apart from the four grounds stated above, which Appellant alleged some error and failed to establish, he did not fault the judgment of the trial Customary Court on any other ground; that the law is trite that where there is an appeal on some points only, against a decision or judgment, the appeal stands or falls on those points appealed against only, while the other point or decisions not appealed remain unchallenged and are deemed to have been accepted or conceded as being correct. He relied on Michael Vs State 200813 NWLR Pt.1104361; MFA v. Inongha 2014 LPELR  22010 SC.  Counsel said a perusal of the grounds 1, 2 and 3 which Appellant sought to introduce as fresh issues shows that the said grounds are not founded on the decision of the lower Court, but on the decision of the Trial customary Court, not appeal against at the lower Court. Thus, he said the said grounds 1, 2 and 3 are incompetent; that before leave can be granted to raise a fresh issue on appeal, the said issue must be competent. He stated the grounds of the incompetence of the said grounds as follows: 1 The Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to entertain Appeal, directly, from the decision of the trial Customary Court, but against the decision of the Customary Court of Appeal  See Section 245 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as amended. He argued that grounds 1, 2 and 3 of the Notice of appeal are inviting this Court Court of Appeal to sit, directly, on appeal over the decision of the trial Customary Court; that no leave can be validly granted to raise grounds of appeal or issues which this Court, has no jurisdiction to entertain. He relied on KLM Royal Dutch Airlines v. Aloma 2017 LPELR  42588 S.C.. He added that Appeal Court cannot entertain a ground of appeal which does not challenge or relate to the ratio of the decision of the judgment appealed against. He relied on Co-operative & Commerce Bank Plc v. Ekperi 2007145 LRCN 571 @ 580; Mercantile Bank Ltd v. Nwobodo 2005 139 LRCN 2269.  Counsel further argued that, even where competent ground of appeal is formulated and proposed, it is settled law that an appeal Court will not lightly entertain an application to raise point of law for the first time before it, and that the discretion to grant leave to raise such fresh issues, on appeal, is exercised cautiously and strictly, and only in special circumstances. He relied on Bankole v. Pelu 199111-12 SC 116 at 137; A.G. Oyo State v. Fairlakes Hotel Ltd 198812 SC Pt.14 at 22; Uor v. Loko 1988 LPELR  3423 SC.  Counsel also relied on Ejiofodomi v. Okonkwo 198211 SC 74, to say that the practice of allowing for raising of fresh issues on appeal cannot be used as a ploy to pursue an appeal by installments, otherwise not only will there be uncertainty, at each appellate stage, as to the extent of a Courts decision that is being appealed against, there will also, consequently, be no end to litigation. He argued that, in this case, Appellant has appealed against the judgment of the trial Customary Court, upon certain grounds, but, after losing the appeal on those grounds, now decides not to challenge the propriety of the decision of the Appeal Court on those grounds he canvassed, but rather chooses to raise before the next Appeal Courts, new grounds of appeal against the decision of the trial Court. He relied on the case of Adegoke Motors Ltd v. Adesanya 1989 LPELR - 97 SC, where it was stated: There is of course a total bar against new points designed to establish a case different from the one considered in the Court below.  Counsel also said that leave to raise fresh issues will be refused, if the fresh point could have, with reasonable diligence, been raised at the Court below, but was not. See Bankole v. Pelu supra at 138 -139.  He added that Appellant had more than ample opportunity to raise before the Customary Court of Appeal the grounds of appeal sought to be raised now for the first time; that he even applied and was granted leave to add eight8 additional grounds of appeal to the original Notice of Appeal at the lower Court.  He urged us to resolve the issue against Appellant.  On issue 2, whether Appellant was entitled [to] be granted leave to file and argue the additional grounds of appeal, numbered 10, 11 and 12 as proposed, in the circumstances of this case, Counsel answered in the negative and said that those grounds did not raise any question of customary law, as they rather raised issues of evaluation of evidence and ascription of probative value to evidence by the Lower Court, which are not issues of customary law. He relied on the case of Okorie v. Chukwu 2014 LPELR- 23744 CA.  Counsel urged us to resolve the issue against the Appellant and to dismiss the Appeal.  Appellants Reply on points of law appears to be a rehash of the entire argument by the Appellant in support of the Application, which is not permitted.  RESOLUTION OF THE ISSUES I think the two issues by the 1st Respondent have captured the essence of the application better and the same rather rephrased the 3 issues by the Appellant, giving same more pungent. I shall, however, take the two issues together.  Is Appellant entitled to grant of leave to raise and argue fresh issues as shown in grounds 1, 2 and 3 of the Notice of Appeal filed on 2392014 andor proposed in grounds 10, 11 and 12 of the Appellants notice of Appeal, filed 962016, along with this motion, as Exhibit A?  Appellant had expressly admitted that the issues which he wants to introduce into the appeal, by way of additional grounds of appeal or fresh issues were not raised at the Court below, and that his Counsel discovered that he inadvertently omitted seeking the leave the of Court before filing the fresh issues which were not raised in the Court below, in the notice of appeal, filed on 23rd day of September, 2014.\" See paragraph a of the grounds for the motion.  I think the above admission completely defeated the whole essence of this application, as Appellant cannot be allowed to raise any issues on appeal, which was not considered in the judgment appealed against, and was not an issue flowing from or related to the ratio decidendi in the said judgment of the lower Court. See Gwede v. INEC 2014 LPELR  23763 SC.  In any event, the law is settled that for an issue to be valid and competent for consideration by the Court, it must arise from a complaint against the decisionjudgment on appeal. Where an issue raised in a brief of argument of either the appellant or respondents does not arise from any of the grounds of appeal, as in the instant case, the issue is incompetent and liable to be struck out. See Seagull Oil Ltd Vs Mon Pulo Ltd 20115 NWLR Pt.525 at 540 per Onnoghen JSC as he then was - later CJN.  In the case of Enyinnaya v. Otikpo & Anor 2015 LPELR  25529 CA, it was held: Of course, the law is trite that issue for determination of appeal must arise or derive from the grounds of appeal, which must, in turn, flow from or be located in the judgment appealed against. Obosi v. NIPOST 2013 LPELR - 21397 CA. See also Oguzie & Ors v. Oguzie 2016 LPELR - 41086 CA, and Nwagbo v. Mba 2016 LPELR - 41045 CA, where my Lord Yakubu JCA, of blessed memory said: “For the law is that an issue for determination, for it to be competent, must flow from a ground of appeal. Hence an issue for determination cannot be formulated in vacuo or from the air. Therefore, just like a ground of appeal must be predicated upon a ratio decidendi in the judgment appealed against, so also an issue for determination must be birthed by a ground of appeal, from which it flows. Khaled Chami v. United Bank for Africa Plc 2010 2, SPDC v. Tigbara Edamkue & Ors 2009 7 SCNJ 124; NPA Plc v. Beecham Pharmaceutical Ltd & Anor 2013 25 WRN 38 at 61  62.\"  Of course, Appellant has admitted that the fresh issues for which he seeks leave to appeal against, as shown in the grounds 1, 2 and 3 of the Appeal or in the grounds 10, 11 and 12 of the proposed Amended Notice of Appeal Exhibit A were not raised at the Court below\"; that his counsel inadvertently omitted to raise the said issues in the grounds of appeal at the Court below. He argued that the Court should not punish Appellant for the mistake of his counsel; that the said issuesgrounds derived from or related to the judgment of the trial Customary Court!  Appellant therefore appears to be seeking this Court to sit on appeal directly over the decision of the trial Customary Court, having not canvassed those groundsissues he wants raise now at the Lower Court Customary Court of Appeal to be tested, thereat. We have stated several times that this Court Court of Appeal has no direct jurisdiction over decision of trial Customary Courts or such other inferior Courts, until such decisions of such Courts are tested at the Customary Court of Appeal or the High Court as the case maybe and a party, still not satisfied, raises an appeal in this Court over the area of his dissatisfaction. See the case of Anyalenkeya v. Anya & Ors 2016 LPELR  40218 CA: This Court Court of Appeal has no direct jurisdiction over the decisions of the Customary Court. We stated this clearly in the case of Enyinnaya v. Otikpo & Anor 2015 LPELR  25529 CA.  Our jurisdiction is over the way the Customary Court of Appeal resolved the issues and matter arising for consideration at the trial Customary Court, and so whatever complaint the Respondent had against the decision of the trial Customary Court, should have been raised and canvassed at the Customary Court of Appeal and, where the latter failed to handle it to the satisfaction of the Respondents, then can appeal, therefore be canvassed before us at the Court of Appeal. This Court has no direct jurisdiction over the decision of the Customary Court, Magistrates Court or District Court, until the same goes through the mill High Court or Customary Court of Appeal and appeal therefrom, comes to us. Therefore, to that extent that issue 1 by the Respondents is a stranger to the ground one of the appeal, the same is hereby struck out, for incompetence. See Ossai v. FRN 201313 WRN 87; AhmadDazomo v. Saleh Musa 2013 LPELR  20761 CA; 2014 All FWLR Pt.743 1866.  It should also be noted, that the law requires the Appellate Court to look at the proposed grounds of appeal in an application for leave or extension of time to appeal or in an application to amend notice of appeal or file additional grounds of appeal. This is to be sure that the proposed grounds is worth the trouble of granting the leave or order sought; that it disclose good and arguable ground of appeal. See Ogembe v. Usman & Ors 2011 LPELR - 8155 SC; C.P.C. v. Nyako & Ors 2011 LPELR  23009SC.  Of course, in appeals from the Customary Court of Appeal to this Court Court of Appeal, the grounds of the appeal or the issues thereof must be on question of customary law, to lie an appeal. See Section 2451 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, as interpreted by myriads of cases. Pam v. Gwom 2000 LPELR  2896 SC; Okorie v. Chukwu 2014 LPELR  23744 CA; Enyinnaya v. Otikpo supra; Onyeme & Anor v. Onumaegbu & Anor 2016 LPELR  41092 CA.  In Anozie v. Emerenini & Anor 2016 LPELR  40968 CA, it was held; relying on Enyinnaya Vs Otikpo supra: I find it difficult to locate the complaint of the Appellant, which, in the main, is a quarrel with the evaluation of evidence, within the rights of the Appellant to appeal under Section 245 1 of the 1999 Constitution, which confines right of appeal to questions of customary law Issues relating to fair hearing, evaluation of evidence, doctrine of estoppels etc, are never issues bordering on questions of Customary law. See Duru v. Okoro 2015 LPELR  24483 CA. Such issues cannot, properly, invoke the jurisdiction of this Court, as valid grounds of appeal from a decision of the Customary Court of Appeal to this Court the Court of Appeal.  This calls for the reproduction of the grounds of appeal which Appellants seeks to raise as fresh issues andor the proposed grounds of appeal, which Appellant seeks leave to introduce into this appeal, in the Exhibit A, attached to the Motion on Notice, that is, the proposed Amended Notice of Appeal of which grounds 10, 11 and 12 therein are said to be the additional grounds Appellant, seeks to raise in the appeal. They state as follows without their particulars  As per Exhibit A: 10 The learned Justices of the Court below erred in law when they held that ground three which touched on customary law of Dikenaofeiyi Community where the parties in this appeal come from never related to the findings and judgment appealed against. 11 The decision of the Lower Court in respect of the interpretation of Exhibit E and other documents which the trial Court relied upon was outside the competence of the Lower Court so to do as a result the Lower Court erred in law in so doing. 12 The Trial Customary Court erred in law when it assumed jurisdiction and entertained, suit No.CCSM302006 when the said suit ought to have been brought in a representative capacity and not in a personal capacity.  In his argument, Appellant was not even harping on the said proposed additional grounds of appeal, but was arguing about the grounds 1, 2 and 3 of the Appeal, filed on 2392014, whereof he sought leave to argue as fresh issues. The said 3 grounds are without their particulars were: 1 The trial Court erred in customary law when it held that the appellant did not prove his title to the land in dispute, when it was very clear from the evidence led before the Trial Court that the Appellant is the only son of Mbagwu and the person entitled to inherit Mbagwu under the native law and custom of Dikenaofeiyi Autonomous Community. 2 The trial Customary Court erred in law when it departed from the age long principle established in the case of Idundun v. Okumagba. 3 The trial Customary Court erred in law when it held that the 1st respondent was forced out of AlaIshiobi Ama and other lands in dispute in spite of the abundant evidence before the Trial Customary Court that the appellant is the only son of Mbagwu and the person entitled to inherit Mbagwu under the native law and custom of Dikenaofeiyi Autonomous Community. See pages 333 to 335 of the Records of Appeal.  Even a casual look at those grounds 1- 3 of appeal, filed on 2392014, and the proposed Amended grounds 10, 11 and 12 of the Appeal  Exhibit A, would show that the said grounds are anything but questions of customary law, arising from the judgment appealed against. They are rather, in my view, attacks against the decision of the trial Customary Court particularly the grounds 1  3 of the grounds of appeal, filed on 23914 and ground 12 of the Exhibit A. And the grounds 10 and 11 of Exhibit A appear to be a quarrel against the way the Lower Court evaluated the evidence and or interpreted some documents. These are not questions of Customary Law Enyinnaya v. Otikpo supra; Anozie v. Emerenini supra and Duru v. Okoro supra.  I had earlier stated that this Court has no direct jurisdiction over the decisions of the Customary Court, and cannot be called upon to consider the error or alleged error made by the trial Customary Court in its judgment! See Anyalenkeya v. Anya supra.  This application cannot therefore be granted in my view. It is hereby refused and dismissed, for lacking in merit.  AppellantApplicant shall pay cost of this application assessed at Fifty Thousand Naira N50,000.00 to the 1st Respondent.   AYOBODE OLUJIMI LOKULO-SODIPE, J.C.A.:  I agree.   IBRAHIM ALI ANDENYANGTSO, J.C.A.:  Having read in draft the judgment of my learned brother, I.G Mbaba JCA just delivered, I entirely agree with him that to grant this application by this Court will be tantamount to turning itself into the Customary Court of Appeal. In other words, this Court will be made to sit on appeal over the judgment of the Customary Court, a Court of first instance.  This Court has no such jurisdiction conferred on it by the Constitution, because its appellate power is to hear appeal from the Customary Court of Appeal of a State as enshrined in Section 245 1 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended which provides thus: 245. 1 An appeal shall lie from decision of a Customary Court of Appeal to the Court of Appeal as by right in any civil proceedings before the Customary Court of Appeal with respect to any question of customary law and such other matters as may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly. It is clear that this Court cannot entertain appeal direct from the Customary Court of a State as the AppellantApplicant would want to make this Court do in this case.  For the above reason and the fuller reasons given in the lead judgment of my Noble Lord, I. G. Mbaba JCA, I hereby refuse the application and same is accordingly dismissed.  I abide by the order of cost made in the lead judgment.-end!" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  Appellant/Applicant filed a motion on 9/6/2016 before the Court of Appeal seeking, among others, for an Order granting leave to the applicant to file and argue fresh issues of customary law which were not raised at the Customary Court of Appeal below from where the appeal emanated. The motion was couched thus:  1) For leave to file and argue fresh issues of customary law not raised at the Court below; and 2) Deeming the fresh issues of customary law contained in the notice of appeal, dated 15th day of September (sic) already filed and served, as having been properly filed and served. The motion arose from an appeal brought by the applicant against the decision of a Customary Court of Appeal upholding the decision of a Customary Court which awarded title over a set of contested land tracts to the respondent. However, on close inspection, the motion was exposed as one seeking to introduce and argue fresh issues bordering on the evaluation of evidence by the trial Customary Court and an issue of customary law not canvassed before the Customary of Appeal thereby allowing that Court to give a decision thereon.-" ;
